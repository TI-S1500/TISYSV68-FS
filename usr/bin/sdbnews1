		   SDB DISASSEMBLER ENHANCEMENTS

The disassembler in this version of sdb has been enhanced for the MC68040
processor.  Each instruction disassembled will be annotated with processor
type, where appropriate.

IMPORTANT:  Disassembled instructions make use of a syntax very similar to
the Assembler Syntax presented in the Motorola Programmer's Reference Manuals.
This is NOT exactly the same as the syntax of the Motorola System Assemblers.
Certain instruction operands may be reversed!  See the Motorola System Assembler
reference manuals for explanations and warnings.


		      SVS COMPILER % SYMBOLS

The special % symbols generated by the SVS C compiler are designed for the
SVS dbg debugger, and are not useful in the sdb environment.  Sdb works
perfectly well with these symbols present, but users cannot interpret the
meaning of the symbols that may get printed out when a breakpoint is taken
or an instruction format dump is printed.

Therefore, sdb has been altered to omit recognition of any procedure name
that begins with %, provided another name exists not beginning with %.

This enhancement may be suppressed by starting sdb with the -z flag.
