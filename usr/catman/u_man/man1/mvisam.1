NAME
     mvisam - Moves T-ISAM files

SYNOPSIS
     mvisam -v src_data [+src_index] ... dest_data [+dest_index]

DESCRIPTION
   Purpose
     The mvisam command moves or renames T-ISAM files, updating
     the internal information so that the new index file location
     is associated with the data file.	Usage of the mv command
     would not update this internal information, sometimes
     resulting in the association of the wrong index file for a
     given data file by T-ISAM.

   Discussion
     Except for the last parameter, which can be a directory,
     parameters beginning with a + character are taken to be T-
     ISAM index file names identified with the preceding T-ISAM
     data file name. In cases where index files are not specified
     for a given data file, the index file normally associated
     with the data file (according to the internal information in
     the data file) will be used. If dest_index is not specified,
     the src_ index file will be moved to the dest_data
     directory, or the directory portion of the dest_data path
     name.

     If dest_data and dest_index (if present) are directories,
     there can be multiple src_data files.  The data files are
     moved to dest_data, and the corresponding index files are
     moved to the dest_index directory if present, otherwise, to
     the dest_data directory.  If dest_data is not a directory,
     there can be only one src_data file .

     It is permissible for src_data and dest_data to be the same
     or for src_index and dest_index to be the same.  This will
     result in the moving of only one part of the whole T-ISAM
     file.

     Each destination data file must be in the same file system
     as the corresponding source data file and each destination
     index file must be in the same file system as the
     corresponding source index file.

   Options
     -v      Verbose.  Lists to standard output exactly which
	     files are moved and where they are moved.

EXAMPLES
     The following example moves file1.dat, along with its index file
     to the directory dir2.

	  mvisam file1.dat dir2

     The next example moves the T-ISAM file contained in
     file1.dat and file1.idx to file2.dat and file2.idx.

	  mvisam file1.dat +file1.idx file2.dat +file2.idx

     The next example moves the T-ISAM file contained in
     file1.dat and file1.idx to the directory dir2.

	  mvisam file1.dat +file1.idx dir2

     To move the files f1.dat, f2.dat, and f3.dat, with
     corresponding indexes f1.idx, f2.idx, and f3.idx, to
     directory dir4, type the following command:

	  mvisam f1.dat +f1.idx f2.dat +f2.idx f3.dat +f3.idx dir4

     The command

	  mvisam file1.dat file2.dat

     will move the file1.dat to file2.dat but will leave file1.idx in its
     original location with its original name.

PROMPTS

   Verbose? (y/n):
     If selected, a list of which files are copied is printed.
