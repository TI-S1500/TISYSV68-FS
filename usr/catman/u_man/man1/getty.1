GETTY(1M)						GETTY(1M)

NAME
     getty  - Sets terminal type, modes, speed, and line
     discipline

SYNOPSIS
     getty -ht line[speed[type[linedisc]]]
     getty -c file

DESCRIPTION
   Purpose
     The getty command is a program invoked by init(1M).  It is
     the second process in the series (init-getty-login-shell)
     that ultimately connects a user with TI System V.

   Options
     -h   Unless getty is invoked with the -h option, getty
	  forces a hangup on the line by setting the speed to
	  zero before setting the speed to the default or
	  specified speed.

     -ttimeout
	  The timeout value is a number that specifies seconds.
	  This option specifies that getty should exit if opening
	  the line succeeds and no one types anything in the
	  specified number of seconds.

     -c   A check option is provided.  When getty is invoked with
	  the -c option and file, it scans the file as if it were
	  scanning /etc/gettydefs and prints the results to the
	  standard output.    If there are any unrecognized modes
	  or improperly constructed entries, it reports them.  If
	  the entries are correct, it prints out the values of
	  the various flags.  See termio(7) to interpret the
	  values.

   Arguments
     line
	  The name of a tty line in /dev to which getty is to
	  attach itself.  The utility uses this string as the
	  name of a file in the /dev directory to open for
	  reading and writing.

     speed
	  The optional second argument, speed, is a label to a
	  speed and tty definition in the file /etc/gettydefs.
	  This definition tells getty at what speed to initially
	  run, what the login message should look like, what the
	  initial tty settings are, and what speed to try next
	  should the user indicate that the speed is
	  inappropriate (by typing a break character).	The
	  default speed is 9600 baud.

     type
	  The optional third argument, type, is a character
	  string describing to getty what type of terminal is
	  connected to the line in question.  The getty utility
	  initializes the TERM environment variable to this
	  string, which should be one of the terminal names found
	  in /etc/termcap.  The default terminal type is none,
	  i.e., any VDT or normal terminal unknown to the system.
	  Also, if the virtual terminal handler for the terminal
	  type has been compiled into the operating system, it
	  will be used.  No virtual terminal handlers are
	  compiled in the default condition.

     linedisc
	  The optional fourth argument, linedisc, is a character
	  string describing which line discipline to use in
	  communicating with the terminal.  Again, the hooks for
	  line disciplines are available in the operating system,
	  but there is only one presently available, the default
	  line discipline, LDISC0.

   Discussion
     Initially getty prints the login message field for the entry
     it is using from /etc/gettydefs.  The getty utility reads
     the user's login name and invokes the login(1) command with
     the user's name as argument.  While reading the name, getty
     attempts to adapt the system to the speed and type of
     terminal being used.

     When given no optional arguments, getty sets the speed of
     the interface to 9600 baud, and specifies that raw mode is
     used (awaken on every character), that echo is suppressed,
     that either parity is allowed, that newline characters are
     converted to carriage return-line feed, and that tab
     expansion is performed on the standard output.  It types the
     login message and then reads the user's name a character at
     a time.  If a null character (or framing error) is received,
     it is assumed to be the result of the user pressing the
     BREAK key.  This action causes getty to attempt the next
     speed in the series.  The series that getty tries is
     determined by what it finds in /etc/gettydefs.

     The user's name is terminated by a newline or carriage-
     return character.	The latter results in the system being
     set to treat carriage returns appropriately. See ioctl(2).

     The user's name is scanned to see if it contains any
     lowercase alphabetic characters; if not, the system is told
     to map any future uppercase characters into the corresponding
     lowercase characters.

     Finally, login is called with the user's name and the
     terminal type as arguments.  Additional arguments may be
     typed after the login name.  These are passed to login,
     which places them in the environment.  Note that some values
     are added to the flags automatically.
