COMM(1)                                                   COMM(1)

NAME
     comm - Selects or rejects lines common to two sorted files

SYNOPSIS
     comm -123 file1 file2

DESCRIPTION
   Purpose
     The comm command reads two files that are ordered in ASCII
     collating sequence (see sort(1)), and produces a three-
     column output.  The output consists of lines only in file1,
     lines only in file2, and lines in both files.  The file name
     - means the standard input.

     Lines longer than 255 characters are truncated after the
     255th character.  Any additional characters are treated as
     the next line in the file.

   Options
     Options 1, 2, or 3 suppress printing of the corresponding
     column.  Thus comm -12 prints only the lines common to the
     two files; comm -23 prints only lines in the first file but
     not in the second; comm -123 produces no output.
