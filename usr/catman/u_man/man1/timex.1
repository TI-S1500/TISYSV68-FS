TIMEX(1)                                                 TIMEX(1)

NAME
     timex - Times a command and reports process data and system
     activity

SYNOPSIS
     timex -fhkmoprst command

DESCRIPTION
   Purpose
     After the given command is executed, timex reports the
     elapsed time, user time, and system time spent in execution.
     The timex command reports time in seconds.  Optionally,
     process accounting data for the command and all its children
     can be listed or summarized, and total system activity
     during the execution interval can be reported.

     The output of timex is written on standard error.

   Options
     -p  Lists process accounting records for command and all its
         children.  This option works only if the process
         accounting software is running.  The suboptions f, h, k,
         m, r, and t modify the data items reported.  The number
         of blocks read or written and the number of characters
         transferred are always reported.

         f    Prints the fork(2) and exec(2) flags and system
              exit status columns in the output.

         h    Prints the fraction of total available CPU time
              consumed by the process during its execution.  This
              hog time is computed as follows:  (total CPU
              time)/(elapsed time).

         k    Prints total kcore-minutes.

         m    Prints mean core size.

         r    Prints CPU factor (user time)/(system time + user
              time).

         t    Prints separate system and user CPU times.

     -o  Reports the total number of blocks read or written and
         total characters transferred by command and all its
         children.  This option works only if the process
         accounting software is running.

     -s  Reports total system activity (not just that caused by
         command) that occurred during the execution interval of
         command.  All the data items listed in sar(1) are
         reported.

EXAMPLES
     The following command is a simple example:

          timex -ops sleep 60

     A terminal session of arbitrary complexity can be measured
     by timing a subshell as follows:

          timex -opskmt sh
            session commands
          EOT

PROMPTS
   Command to be Timed:
     Enter the command to execute and time.

   Total Number of Blocks:
     The initial value is no.  Enter yes to print the total
     number of blocks read or written and total characters
     transferred by the specified command and its children.

   Report System Activity:
     The initial value is no.  Enter yes to print total system
     activity that occurred during the execution interval of the
     specified command.

   Show Accounting Record Options:
     The initial value is no.  Enter yes to receive the following
     prompts.

   Print Fork/Exec Flag:
     The initial value is no.  Enter yes to print flags from the
     fork and exec system calls.

   Total Available CPU Time:
     The initial value is no.  Enter yes to print the fraction of
     available CPU time consumed by the specified process during
     its execution.

   Total Kcore Minutes:
     The initial value is no.  Enter yes to print total kcore-
     minutes.

   Print Mean Core Size:
     The initial value is no.  Enter yes to print mean core size.

   Print CPU Factor:
     The initial value is no.  Enter yes to print (user
     time)/(ststem time + user time).

   Separate System/User Times:
     The initial value is no.  Enter yes to print separate system
     and user times.

NOTES
     Process records associated with command are selected from
     the accounting file /usr/adm/pacct by inference, since
     process genealogy is not available.  Reports of background
     processes having the same user ID, terminal ID, and
     execution time window will be included with the report to
     the command.
