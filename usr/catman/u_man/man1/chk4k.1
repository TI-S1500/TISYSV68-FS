NAME                                                                
     chk4k - Checks to see if V/68 executables are linked on 4K-    
     byte boundaries                                                

SYNOPSIS                                                            
     chk4k files                                                    

DESCRIPTION                                                         
   Purpose                                                          
     Future releases of TI System V may not support executables     
     that are not linked on 4K-byte boundaries. chk4k is a          
     utility that provides a way to check your executables and      
     determine if they need to be relinked with the latest          
     linker.                                                        

     chk4k examines V/68 executable files to see if they have       
     been linked on 4K-byte boundaries. Files are first examined    
     to see if they have a magic number corresponding to V/68       
     executables (see /etc/magic). Then the files are checked to    
     ensure that they are indeed executable. If the file is not a   
     V/68 executable, it is ignored; otherwise, remainder           
     arithmetic is performed on the physical address of the data    
     section in the data section header. If the address is a        
     multiple of 4096, a message is returned to standard out that   
     the program is linked on a 4K-byte boundary. If the address    
     is not a multiple of 4096, a warning message is returned.      

EXAMPLES                                                            
     The following example determines if the program prog3 is       
     linked on a 4K-byte boundary.

               chk4k prog3                                                

     The output of the command would be:                                  

               prog3 is 4k byte aligned                                   

     or

               Warning: prog3 is not linked on a 4k byte boundary         

     If prog3 is a nonexecutable V/68 file, the preceding command   
     simply returns the TI System V prompt, and no message is       
     displayed.


     To check all of the V/68 executables in /bin, you would use:         

               chk4k /bin/* | grep Warning                                

NOTES                                                               
     chk4k requires that the user has read permissions on the       
     files that are being checked.                                  

FILES                                                               
     /etc/magic
