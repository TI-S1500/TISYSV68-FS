AT(1)                                                       AT(1)

NAME
     at - Executes commands at a later time

SYNOPSIS
     at time [date] [+increment]
     at -rjobs
     at -l [jobs]

DESCRIPTION
   Purpose
     The at command reads commands from standard input to be
     executed at a later time.  The command also removes or lists
     jobs previously scheduled with at.

   Discussion
     Standard output and standard error output are mailed to the
     user unless they are redirected elsewhere.  The shell
     environment variables, current directory, umask, and ulimit
     are retained when the commands are executed.  Open file
     descriptors, traps, and priority are lost.

     Users are permitted to use at if their names appear in the
     file /usr/lib/cron/at.allow.  If that file does not exist,
     the file /usr/lib/cron/at.deny is checked to determine if
     the user should be denied access to at.  If neither file
     exists, only root is allowed to submit a job.  If only
     at.deny exists and is empty, global usage is permitted.  The
     allow and deny files consist of one user name per line.

   Arguments
     time Specifies time as one, two, or four digits.  One- and
          two-digit numbers are interpreted as hours.  Four
          digits are interpreted to be hours and minutes.  The
          time can alternately be specified as two numbers
          separated by a colon, meaning hour:minute.  A suffix am
          or pm can be appended.  Otherwise a 24-hour clock time
          is understood.  The suffix zulu can be used to indicate
          Greenwich mean time (GMT).  The special names noon,
          midnight, now, and next are also recognized.

     date Specifies either a month name followed by a day number
          (and possibly year number preceded by an optional
          comma) or a day of the week (fully spelled or
          abbreviated to three characters).  Two special days,
          today and tomorrow, are recognized.  If no date is
          given, today is assumed if the given hour is greater
          than the current hour and tomorrow is assumed if it is
          less.  If the given month is less than the current
          month (and no year is given), next year is assumed.

     increment
          Specifies a number suffixed by one of the following:
          minutes
          hours
          days
          weeks
          months
          years

          The singular form is also accepted; for example, minute
          or year.

     The at command writes the job number and schedule time to
     standard error.

   Options
     -rjobs
          Removes jobs previously scheduled by at.  The jobs
          value is the job number reported when the previous at
          was executed.

     -l   Lists job numbers.  If you are not super-user, at -l
          will list only your job numbers.

EXAMPLES
     The following are legal commands:

          at 0815am Jan 24
          at 8:15am Jan 24
          at now + 1 day
          at 5 pm Friday

     The at and batch commands read from standard input the
     commands to be executed at a later time. sh(1) provides
     different ways of specifying standard input. Within your
     commands, it may be useful to redirect standard output.

     This sequence can be used at a terminal:

          batch
          sort filename > outfile
          <Control-D> (hold down Control and press D)

     This sequence, which demonstrates redirecting standard error
     to a pipe, is useful in a shell procedure (the sequence of
     output redirection specifications is significant):
          batch <<!
          sort filename 2>&1 > outfile | mail loginid
          !

     To have a job reschedule itself, invoke at from within the
     shell procedure by including code similar to the following
     within the shell file.

          echo "sh shellfile" | at 1900 thursday next week

PROMPTS
   Input File Name:
     Enter the name of the file that contains commands to be
     input to the shell.

   Time:
     Enter the time when the specified file is to be input to the
     shell.

FILES
     /usr/lib/cron  Main cron directory

     /usr/lib/cron/at.allow
                    List of allowed users (this file is not
                    shipped with the system)

     /usr/lib/cron/at.deny
                    List of denied users (this file is not
                    shipped with the system)

     /usr/lib/cron/log
                    Log file

     /usr/lib/cron/queue
                    Scheduling information

     /usr/spool/cron/atjobs
                    Spool area

     cron(1M), crontab(1), kill(1), mail(1), nice(1), ps(1),
     sh(1).

DIAGNOSTICS
     The utility displays messages about various syntax errors
     and times out of range.

NOTES
     Commands such as write(1) that try to determine the tty name
     of standard input may exhibit strange behavior when run by
     batch.

     The owner of the files /usr/lib/cron/at.allow and
     /usr/lib/cron/at.deny must be root, the group sys, and the
     mode 644.
