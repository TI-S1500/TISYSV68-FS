BASENAME(1)                                           BASENAME(1)

NAME
     basename - Delivers portions of path names

SYNOPSIS
     basename string suffix

DESCRIPTION
   Purpose
     The basename program deletes from string any prefix ending
     in / and the suffix (if present in string).  The program
     prints the result on the standard output.  It is normally
     used inside substitution marks (``) within shell procedures.

EXAMPLE
     The following example, invoked with the argument
     /usr/src/cmd/xmpl.c, compiles the named file and moves the
     output to a file named xmpl in the current directory.  Note
     that cc(1) stores its output in a file named a.out.

          cc $1
          mv a.out `basename $1 .c`

SEE ALSO
     sh(1), dirname(1).

NOTES
     The basename of / is null and is considered an error.
