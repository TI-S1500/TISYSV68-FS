GREP(1)                                                   GREP(1)

NAME
     grep - Searches a file for a pattern

SYNOPSIS
     grep -bcilnsv expression files

DESCRIPTION
   Purpose
     The grep command searches the input files (standard input is
     the default) for lines matching a regular expression.  See
     Regular Expressions in ed(1) for a definition of regular
     expressions.  Normally, each line found is copied to the
     standard output.

   Options
     -b   Each line is preceded by the block number on which it
          was found.  This is sometimes useful in locating disk
          block numbers by context.

     -c   A total count of matching lines is printed.

     -i   Ignores uppercase and lowercase distinction in
          comparison.

     -l   The names of files with matching lines are listed
          (once), separated by newlines.

     -n   Each line is preceded by its relative line number in
          the file.

     -s   The error messages produced for nonexistent or
          unreadable files are suppressed.

     -v   All lines but those matching are printed.

   Discussion
     The grep command cannot find a string in an executable file.

     In all cases, the file name is output if there is more than
     one input file.  Be careful when using the characters $, *,
     [, ^, |, (, ), and \ in expression because they are also
     meaningful to the shell.  It is safest to enclose the entire
     expression argument in single quotes '...'.

EXAMPLE
     The following example searches file1, file2, and file3 for
     the words 'program name'.  Line numbers where the words
     occur are reported.  Error messages, if any, are not
     printed.  The file name is printed for each input file that
     contains the specified pattern.

          grep -ns 'program name' file1 file2 file3

PROMPTS
   Input File Name(s):
     Enter the names of the files to search.

   Output File Name:
     Response to this prompt is optional.  Enter the name of the
     file to receive the command output.

   Pattern for Search:
     Enter the pattern to match. The expression should not be
     enclosed in quotes.

   Print All But Matching Lines:
     The initial value is no.  Enter yes to print all lines
     except those that match the pattern.

   Count Matching Lines:
     The initial value is no.  Enter yes to print a count of the
     matching lines.

   Ignore Upper/Lower Case:
     Initial value is no. Enter yes to make no distinction
     between upper and lowercase letters.

   File Names Only:
     The initial value is no.  Enter yes to print the names of
     the files with matching lines.

   Print File Line Numbers:
     The initial value is no.  Enter yes to precede the matching
     lines by their relative line numbers.

   Print Block Numbers:
     The initial value is no.  Enter yes to print the block
     numbers as well as the lines that match.

   Suppress Error messages:
     The initial value is no.  Enter yes to suppress printing of
     error messages.

DIAGNOSTICS
     Exit status is 0 if any matches are found, 1 if none, 2 for
     syntax errors or inaccessible files (even if matches were
     found).

NOTES
     Lines are limited to 512 characters.  Longer lines are
     broken into separate lines.
