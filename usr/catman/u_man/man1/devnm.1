DEVNM(1M)                                               DEVNM(1M)

NAME
     devnm - Identifies the name of the device where a file
     resides

SYNOPSIS
     devnm [names]

DESCRIPTION
   Purpose
     The devnm command identifies the special file associated
     with the mounted file system where the argument name
     resides.  If swapping occurs on the same disk section as the
     root file system, both the block device name and the swap
     device name are printed for the argument name /.  Argument
     names must be full path names.

   Discussion
     This command is most commonly used by the /etc/rc shell
     script to report a mount table entry for the root device.

EXAMPLE
     If /usr is mounted on /dev/dsk/sys:usr, the command
     /etc/devnm /usr produces both /dev/dsk/c01u00s012 /usr and
     /dev/dsk/sys:usr /usr.

FILES
     /dev/dsk/*
     /etc/mnttab
