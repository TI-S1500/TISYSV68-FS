FINDISAM(1T)					       FINDISAM(1T)

NAME
     findisam - Finds T-ISAM file pairs

SYNOPSIS
     findisam -fnsv dir file

DESCRIPTION
   Purpose
     Given a T-ISAM data (or index) file, the findisam utility finds
     potential corresponding index (or data) files and prints these
     files to standard output.

   Discussion
     T-ISAM files are often kept in two actual files.  One
     contains the data and the other contains index information.
     When a T-ISAM file is so split, the data file contains the
     name of the associated index file in its internal data (that
     is, not part of the data contents of the file).  When the
     index file is moved or copied without using the mvisam or
     cpisam utilities or the tirename function, this internal
     name will have the wrong value.  This can result in the
     inability of some programs to access the T-ISAM file.

     When a split T-ISAM file is opened for possible output, a
     unique usage stamp is placed in both the actual files.  This
     utility searches the directory dir for a data (or index) file
     that has the same usage stamp as the index (or data) file file.

   Options
     -f      Searches only until the first match is found.

     -n      Checks only files whose root name (the part of the
	     name following the last ``/'' and preceding the last
	     period) is the same as the root name of file.

     -s      Searches all subdirectories of dir.

     -v      Verbose.  Includes report of errors, etc.

EXAMPLES
     The following example searches for the first T-ISAM data
     file in the current working directory and its subdirectories
     that contains the same unique value as the T-ISAM index file
     f.idx.

	       findisam -sf  .	f.idx

     The next example reports all T-ISAM data files that have a
     root name work and that have the same unique value as the
     T-ISAM index file /usr/fred/isam/work.idx. Error
     conditions will be reported.

	       findisam -snv / /usr/fred/isam/work.idx


PROMPTS
   Directory:
     Enter the directory to be searched.

   File:
     Enter the name of the T-ISAM data or index file for which a
     partner is required.

   First Match Only? (y/n):
     Initial value is no.  If y, the program will stop when the
     first match is found.

   Search Subdirectories? (y/n):
     Initial value is yes.  If y, all subdirectories of the
     specified directory will be searched.

   Files with Same Name Only? (y/n):
     Initial value is no.  If y, only files with the same root
     name as the specified file will be searched.

   Verbose? (y/n):
     Initial value is no.  If y, errors accessing files will be
     reported to the screen.
