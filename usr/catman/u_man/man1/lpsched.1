LPSCHED(1M)                                           LPSCHED(1M)

NAME
     lpsched - Starts the LP scheduler

SYNOPSIS
     /usr/lib/lpsched

DESCRIPTION
     lpsched starts the LP print service; this can be done only
     by root or lp.

NOTES
     By default, the directory /usr/spool/lp is used to hold all
     the files used by the LP print service. This can be changed
     by setting the SPOOLDIR environment variable to another
     directory before running lpsched. If you do this, you should
     populate the directory with the same files and directories
     found under /usr/spool/lp; the LP print service will not
     automatically create them. Also, the SPOOLDIR variable must
     the be set before any of the other LP print service commands
     are run.

FILES
     /usr/spool/lp/*
