NAME
     nm - Prints name list of common object file

SYNOPSIS
     nm -defhnoTuvVx files

DESCRIPTION
   Purpose
     The nm command displays the symbol table of each common
     object file file.

   Options
     Options can be used in any order, either singly or in
     combination, and can appear anywhere in the command line.
     For example, both nm name -e -v and nm -ve name print the
     static and external symbols in name, with external symbols
     sorted by value.

     -d   Prints the value and size of a symbol in decimal
	  instead of hexadecimal (the default).

     -e   Prints only static and external symbols.

     -f   Produces full output.  Redundant symbols (.text, .data,
	  .bss), normally suppressed, are printed.

     -h   Suppresses display of the output header data.

     -n   Sorts external symbols by name before they are printed.

     -o   Prints the value and size of a symbol in octal instead
	  of hexadecimal.

     -T   Truncates long names.  By default, nm prints the entire
	  name of the symbols listed.  Since object files can
	  have symbol names with an arbitrary number of
	  characters, a name that is longer than the width of the
	  column set aside for names will overflow, forcing every
	  column after the name to be misaligned.  The -T option
	  causes nm to truncate every name which would otherwise
	  overflow its column and place an asterisk as the last
	  character in the displayed name to mark it as
	  truncated.

     -u   Prints undefined symbols only.

     -v   Sorts external symbols by value before they are
	  printed.

     -V   Prints the version of the nm command executing on the
	  standard error output.

     -x   Prints the value and size of a symbol in hexadecimal.

   Discussion
     The file argument can be a relocatable or absolute common
     object file, or it can be an archive of relocatable or
     absolute common object files.  The nm command prints the
     following information for each symbol.

     Name
	  The name of the symbol.

     Value
	  Its value expressed as an offset or an address
	  depending on its storage class.

     Class
	  Its storage class.

     Tv   If the symbol is accessed through a transfer vector,
	  this field contains tv.

     Type
	  Its type and derived type.  If the symbol is an
	  instance of a structure or a union, the structure or
	  union tag is given following the type (e.g., struct-
	  tag).  If the symbol is an array, the array dimensions
	  are given following the type (e.g., char[n] [m]).

     Size
	  Its size in bytes, if available.

     Line
	  The source line number at which it is defined, if
	  available.

     Section
	  For storage classes static and external, the object
	  file section containing the symbol (e.g., .text, .data,
	  or .bss).

     File
	  The name of the object file (if the -e option is
	  specified).

PROMPTS
   Input File Name(s):
     Optional. Enter the names of the files to process.

   Symbol Value/Size in Decimal:
     Initial value is yes.

   Symbol Value/Size in Octal:
     Initial value is no.

   Symbol Value/Size in Hexadecimal:
     Initial value is no.

   Display Output Header:
     Initial value is yes.  If you enter no, the output header is
     not printed.

   Sort Symbols by Value:
     Initial value is no.  If you enter yes, the external symbols
     are sorted by value before they are displayed.

   Sort Symbols by Name:
     Initial value is no.  If you enter yes, the external symbols
     are sorted by name before they are displayed.

   Print Static/External Sym:
     Initial value is no.  If you enter yes, only static and
     external symbols are printed.

   Print Undefined Symbols Only:
     Initial value is no.  If you enter yes, only undefined
     symbols are printed.

   Full Output:
     Initial value is no.  If you enter yes, redundant symbols
     normally suppressed are printed.

   Print Version Number:
     Initial value is no.  If you enter yes, the version number
     of this process is printed.

   Truncate Long Names:
     Initial value is no.  If you enter yes, the names of symbols
     are truncated and marked.

FILES

DIAGNOSTICS
     nm:  name:  cannot open	 name cannot be read.
     nm:  name:  bad magic	 name is not an appropriate
				   common object file.
     nm:  name:  no symbols	 The symbols have been stripped
				   from name.
NOTES
     When all the symbols are printed, they must be printed in
     the order they appear in the symbol table in order to
     preserve scoping information.  Therefore, the -v and -n
     options should be used only in conjunction with the -e
     option.
