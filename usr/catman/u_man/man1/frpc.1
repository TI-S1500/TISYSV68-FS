FRPC(1T)						 FRPC(1T)

NAME
     frpc - Transfers a file from a host computer to a System
     1000 Series computer

SYNOPSIS
     frpc -bdrtx pcfile unixfile

DESCRIPTION
   Purpose
     The frpc command transfers a file from a host computer to a
     System 1000 Series computer.  The host computer can be a
     Texas Instruments Professional computer (TIPC) running the
     931 terminal emulator package, version 2.0 or higher, or a
     TI BUSINESS-PRO(TM) computer running the 924 terminal emulator
     package, or any IBM(R)-compatible computer running the 924
     emulator.

     To abort the transfer, press the Command key of the 931 or
     924 emulator.

   Options
     -b   Sends the file as binary data and prevents removal of
	  carriage returns.

     -d dev
	  Allows the file transfer to be initiated from one
	  terminal with the actual transfer occurring from a
	  terminal attached to the device specified by dev.  Only
	  the super-user can specify this option.  The device dev
	  cannot be in use by any other process, including getty
	  and the shell.  The devadm(1T) utility should be used
	  to turn off the device.  Use devadm to specify off in
	  the action field of the devadm display, and respond no
	  to the Auto Init (y or n): prompt.

     -r   Replaces the destination file if it already exists.

     -t nn
	  Set time-out to nn seconds to receive characters from
	  the emulator.  The allowed range for nn is 5 to 256.
	  If this option is not specified, the default value is
	  10 seconds.

     -x filename
	  Creates a file named filename and places in the file a
	  trace of the file transfer.  This option should be used
	  when a file transfer problem is encountered and should
	  be reported to Texas Instruments.

   Arguments
     pcfile    The  name of the file to transfer from the host
	       computer.  The file name and path name combined
	       cannot exceed 40 characters in length.  To enter a
	       backslash, \, enter two backslashes, \\ or enter
	       one forward slash, /.

     unixfile  The name that the transferred file will have on
	       the System 1000 Series computer.  This name can be
	       a path name.

EXAMPLE
     The following example transfers a host file named binfile in
     the directory named \scratch to the System 1000 Series file
     named binfile.  The command preserves carriage returns
     because the -b option is specified.

	  frpc -b -r \\scratch\\binfile binfile
