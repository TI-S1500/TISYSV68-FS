LPUSERS(1M)                                           LPUSERS(1M)

NAME
     lpusers - Sets printing queue priorities

SYNOPSIS
     /usr/lib/lpusers -d priority-level
     /usr/lib/lpusers -q priority-level -u user-list
     /usr/lib/lpusers -u user-list
     /usr/lib/lpusers -q priority-level
     /usr/lib/lpusers -l

DESCRIPTION
     The lpusers command is used to set limits to the queue
     priority level that can be assigned to jobs submitted by
     users of the LP print service.

     The first form of the command (with -d) sets the systemwide
     priority default to priority-level, where priority-level is
     a value of 0 to 39, with 0 being the highest priority.  If a
     user does not specify a priority level with a print request
     (see lp(1)), the default priority is used.  Initially, the
     default priority level is 20.

     The second form of the command (with -q and -u) sets the
     default highest priority-level (0-39) that the users in
     user-list can request when submitting a print request.
     Users that have been given a limit cannot submit a print
     request with a higher priority level than the one assigned,
     nor can they change a request already submitted to have a
     higher priority.  Any print requests with priority levels
     higher than allowed will be given the highest priority
     allowed.

     The third form of the command (with -u) removes the users
     from any explicit priority level and returns them to the
     default priority level.

     The fourth form of the command (with -q) sets the default
     highest priority level for all users not explicitly covered
     by the use of the second form of this command.

     The last form of the command (with -l) lists the default
     priority level and the priority limits assigned to users.
