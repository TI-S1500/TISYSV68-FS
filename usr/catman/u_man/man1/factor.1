FACTOR(1)						FACTOR(1)

NAME
     factor - Factors a number

SYNOPSIS
     factor [number]

DESCRIPTION
     When factor is invoked without an argument, it waits for a
     number to be typed in.  If you type in a positive number
     less than 2E56 (about 7.2x10E16) it will factor the number and
     print its prime factors. Each factor is printed the proper
     number of times.  The utility then waits for another number,
     and exits if it encounters a zero or any nonnumeric
     character.

     If factor is invoked with an argument, it factors the number
     as above and then exits.

     Maximum time to factor is proportional to the square root of n and occurs
     when n is prime or the square of a prime.

PROMPTS
   Number to be Factored:
     Enter the number to be factored.

DIAGNOSTICS
     The utility displays the message ``Ouch!'' when it
     encounters input out of range or garbage input.
