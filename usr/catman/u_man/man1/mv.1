MV(1)                                                       MV(1)

NAME
     mv - Moves files

SYNOPSIS
     mv -f file1 target
     mv -f file1 [ file2 ...]  target_directory
     mv -f directory1 target_directory

DESCRIPTION
   Purpose
     The mv command moves or renames files and renames
     directories.

   Discussion
     In the first form, file1 is renamed target.  Under no
     circumstance can file1 and target be the same (take care
     when using shell metacharacters).  If target is a file, its
     contents are destroyed.

     In the second form, file1 through filen are moved from their
     current location to a new directory.  The move occurs even
     if the target is owned by another user or group.

     In the third form, a directory is given a new name.  The
     following conditions apply:

     + The target name must not already exist.

     + The new name must have the same parent as the existing
       name.

     + Write access to the parent is required.

     + You must have super-user privileges.

     If target is a link to another file with links, the other
     links remain and target becomes a new file.

   Options
     -f   If mv determines that the mode of target forbids
          writing, prints the mode (see chmod(2)), asks for a
          response from the user, and reads the standard input
          for one line.  If the line begins with y, indicating
          yes, mv executes if permissible.  If changing modes is
          not permitted, the command exits.

          If the -f option is specified or if the standard input
          is not a terminal, the prompt asking to change write
          permission is suppressed and the command executes.

EXAMPLE
     Assume that the file named writeoff exists with owner write
     permission off.  You wish to move the file named dummy (with
     mode 666) to writeoff.  Enter the following command:

          mv dummy writeoff

     The following message is displayed:

          writeoff is write protected (mode= 466).  Override?

     Enter y and press RETURN.  Dummy is moved to writeoff and
     the mode of file writeoff is now 666.

PROMPTS
   File or Directory Name(s):
     Enter the name(s) of the file(s) or directory to be moved or
     renamed.

   Target Name:
     Enter the new name of the file or directory.

   Override Write Protect:
     Initial value is no.  If you enter yes, the prompt asking to
     change write permission is suppressed and the command
     executes.

     If the target file or directory exists the following warning
     will be given:

          TARGET FILE OR DIRECTORY EXISTS AND WILL BE ALTERED

   Execute Command:
     Initial value is no.  If you enter yes, the process will be
     executed.  If you enter no, the process will abort.

SEE ALSO
     chmod(2), cp(1), cpio(1), mvdir(1M), ln(1), rm(1).

NOTES
     If file1 and target exist on different file systems, mv must
     copy the file and delete the original.  In this case, any
     linking relationship with other files is lost.  Files . and
     .. cannot be renamed.
