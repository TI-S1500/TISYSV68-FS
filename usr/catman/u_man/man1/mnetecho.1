MNETECHO(1T)                                         MNETECHO(1T)

NAME
     mnetecho - Echoes MTC network messages

SYNOPSIS
     mnetecho -cdemnx

DESCRIPTION
   Purpose
     The mnetecho command verifies multidrop terminal
     concentrator (MTC) network communication capabilities
     between the System 1500 computer and an MTC on the network.
     This command is supported for CCB devices that have been
     configured with the multidrop host adapter (MHA) option.

     In a limited sense, the user can determine where a
     communication failure exists by executing mnetecho.  The
     command verifies that the System 1500 computer and MTC and
     the network between them are operational by transmitting
     known messages to the specified MTC on the network and
     receiving the echoes of those same messages from that MTC.

   Options
     -c count  Transmits count number of messages.  The default
               is 10.

     -d        Disables the real-time status display.  This
               allows disabling updates to the screen to allow
               maximum performance testing with mnetecho.  The -d
               option must be used when executing mnetecho from a
               hardcopy terminal.

     -e        Overrides errors and continues to transmit
               messages. Press Ctrl-C to stop the command.

     -m mtcname
               Scans the /etc/mtctab file for mtcname and obtains
               the physical address (slot, port, and address) of
               the MTC.  The mtcname is the global name of an
               MTC.

     -n size   Specifies the minimum echo data size.  The default
               is 1 byte of echo data.  The mnetecho command
               varies the echo data size by increasing the size
               by 1 byte and wraps between the minimum and
               maximum echo data size.

     -x size   Specifies the maximum echo data size.  The default
               is 128 bytes of echo data.  The mnetecho command
               varies the echo data size by increasing the size
               by 1 byte and wraps between the minimum and
               maximum echo data size.

   Discussion
     The mnetecho command performs limited verification that your
     machine can successfully communicate with an MTC on your
     network.  During the execution of mnetecho, a series of
     messages is sent to the  MTC you specify.  That MTC then
     returns those same messages to your system.  The mnetecho
     command verifies that the messages returned are exact echoes
     of the messages sent.  By determining the MTCs with which
     you can communicate, network problems can be isolated.

     If errors are encountered, it is likely that problems exist
     at that MTC. You should verify that mnetecho successfully
     completes communication to at least one MTC before deciding
     that your site is operating properly.

     If you execute the mnetecho command from a hardcopy data
     terminal, use the -d option to disable the real-time screen
     updates.

EXAMPLES
     The following example illustrates how to verify
     communication with the MTC whose global name is ENGttys.  In
     this example, mnetecho sends out a total of 10 messages.

               mnetecho -m ENGttys

     While mnetecho executes, the counts displayed are
     dynamically updated, unless the -d option is used. When
     mnetecho completes successfully, the total errors field
     displayed is 0.

     The following is output from mnetecho:

     mnetecho to name:     ENGttys  slot:03      port: 1 address:0
     echos: 10       min size: 1                         max size:  128
     send: frame # of size  receive: frame # of size  total errors:
                 10      10                10      10             0
     Echo complete for 10 frames

DIAGNOSTICS
     If mnetecho encounters an error, the total errors field in
     the real-time display is incremented.  Following completion
     of the mnetecho command, an error summary is displayed if
     errors were encountered.  When an error occurs, make note of
     any information that appears.
