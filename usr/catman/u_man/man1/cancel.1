CANCEL(1)                                               CANCEL(1)

NAME
     cancel - Cancels requests to an LP print service

SYNOPSIS
     cancel [request-ids] [printers]

DESCRIPTION
     The cancel command cancels printer requests that were made
     by the lp(1) command.  The command line arguments can be
     either request-ids (as returned by lp(1)) or printer names
     (for a complete list, use lpstat(1)).  Specifying a
     request-id cancels the associated request even if it is
     currently printing.  Specifying a printer cancels the
     request that is currently printing on that printer.  In
     either case, the cancellation of a request that is currently
     printing frees the printer to print its next available
     request.
