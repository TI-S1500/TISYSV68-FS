MC68AS(1)                                               MC68AS(1)

NAME
     mc68as - Invokes the 68010 portable assembler

SYNOPSIS
     mc68as -nmoRV file

DESCRIPTION
   Purpose
     The mc68as command assembles the named file.

   Options
     The following options may be specified in any order:

     -o objfile  Puts the output of the assembly in objfile.  By
                 default, the output file name is formed by
                 removing the .s suffix, if there is one, from
                 the input file name and appending a .o suffix.

     -n          Turns off long/short address optimization.  By
                 default, address optimization takes place.

     -m          Runs the m4 macro preprocessor on the input to
                 the assembler.

     -R          Removes (unlinks) the input file after assembly
                 is completed.

     -V          Writes the version number of the assembler being
                 run on the standard error output.

FILES
     /usr/tmp/as[1-6]XXXXXX temporary files

SEE ALSO
     a.out(4), ld(1), m4(1), nm(1), strip(1).

WARNING
     If the -m (m4 macro preprocessor invocation) option is used,
     keywords for m4 cannot be used as symbols (variables,
     functions, labels) in the input file since m4 cannot
     determine which are assembler symbols and which are real m4
     macros.  See m4(1).

     Use the -b or -w option only when undefined symbols are
     known to refer to locations representable by the specified
     default displacement.  Use of either option when assembling
     a file containing a reference to a symbol that is to be
     resolved by the loader can lead to unpredictable results,
     since the loader may be unable to place the address of the
     symbol into the space provided.

NOTES
     The .align assembler directive is not guaranteed to work in
     the .text section when optimization is performed.

     Arithmetic expressions may only have one forward referenced
     symbol per expression.
