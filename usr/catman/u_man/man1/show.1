SHOW(1T)						 SHOW(1T)

NAME
     show - Produces a scrollable display

SYNOPSIS
     show file

DESCRIPTION
   Purpose
     The show utility uses the terminal-local-file (TLF) as the
     presentation space for command results and other displays.
     Function keys enable the user to page back and forth through
     the TLF without loss of data, using familiar, single-key
     commands to control the part of the file that is shown.

   Discussion
     If show is used on the end of a pipe, the output of the pipe
     is stored in a file named TLF and is then scrolled to the
     screen.  If a subsequent show command uses TLF as the file
     name, show retrieves this pipe output.  The show command
     also interprets the file name SEL as the system error log.

     When the user enters show at the command line or selects a
     display from a menu, the utility responds by displaying the
     first screen of lines from the file.  (A line is assumed to
     be a string of characters terminated by \n.)  At that point,
     show accepts the following commands and gives the indicated
     responses:

     F1 or J	       Moves to next screen (23 lines)

     F2 or K	       Moves back to previous screen

     F3 or H	       Moves left 10 characters

     F4 or L	       Moves right 10 characters

     k or up arrow     Moves up one line

     j or down arrow   Moves down one line

     h or <-	       Moves left one character

     l or ->	       Moves right one character

     n		       Toggles line numbers

     q or Q	       Exits the utility

     ?		       Displays help screen

     t		       Moves to the top of the file

     b		       Moves to the bottom of the file

     /string	       Searches forward for string (the line
		       containing string is displayed as the
		       second line)

     \string	       Searches backward for string (the line
		       containing string is displayed as the
		       second line)

     #n 	       Goes to line n

     +n 	       Goes n lines toward end

     -n 	       Goes n lines toward beginning

     E		       If an error message exists in the
		       displayed file, this command interprets
		       error messages on the screen.

PROMPTS
   File name:
     Enter the name of the file to display.

NOTES
     If a command is piped to show, and the output of the command
     is slow, show waits until it has a full screen of data (or
     the pipe is closed) before continuing.
