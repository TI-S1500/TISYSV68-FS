STRCLEAN(1M)                                         STRCLEAN(1M)

NAME
     strclean - Specifies the STREAMS error logger clean-up
     program

SYNOPSIS
     strclean [ -d logdir ] [-a age ]

DESCRIPTION
     strclean is used to clean up the STREAMS error logger
     directory on a regular basis (for example, by using
     cron(1M)).  By default, all files with names matching
     error.* in /usr/adm/streams that have not been modified in
     the last 3 days are removed.  A directory other than
     /usr/adm/streams can be specified using the -d option.  The
     maximum age in days for a log file can be changed using the
     -a option.

EXAMPLE
          strclean -d /usr/adm/streams -a 3

     has the same result as running strclean with no arguments.

NOTES
     strclean is typically run from cron(1M) on a daily or weekly
     basis.

FILES
     /usr/adm/streams/error.*

SEE ALSO
     cron(1M), strerr(1M).
