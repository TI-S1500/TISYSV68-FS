TTY(1)                                                     TTY(1)

NAME
     tty - Gets the terminal's name

SYNOPSIS
     tty -ls

DESCRIPTION
   Purpose
     The tty command prints the path name of the user's terminal.

   Options
     -l   Prints the synchronous line number to which the user's
          terminal is connected (if it is on an active
          synchronous line).

     -s   Inhibits printing of the terminal's path name, allowing
          the user to test the exit code only.

EXAMPLE
     The command tty -l might return output similar to the
     following:

          /dev/tty4
          tty: Not an active synchronous line (INFO 1002312)

PROMPTS
   Synchronous Line Number:
     Initial value is no. If yes is entered the synchronous line
     number to which the user's terminal is connected is
     reported.

   Inhibit Printing Terminal's Path Name:
     Initial value is no.  If you enter yes, the terminal's path
     name is not printed.

DIAGNOSTICS
     Not an active synchronous line  Means the standard input is
                                     not a synchronous terminal
                                     and the -l option is
                                     specified.

     not a tty                       Means the standard input is
                                     not a terminal and the -s
                                     option is not specified.

     The utility returns the following exit codes:

     2    Invalid options have been specified

     0    Standard input is a terminal

     1    Normal exit
