WHAT(1)                                                   WHAT(1)

NAME
     what - Identifies SCCS files

SYNOPSIS
     what -s files

DESCRIPTION
   Purpose
     The what command searches the given files for all
     occurrences of the pattern that get(1) substitutes for %Z%
     and prints out what follows until the first ", >, new-line,
     \, or null character.  Currently, @(#) is the pattern that
     get substitutes for %Z%.

     The what command is intended to be used in conjunction with
     the  command get(1), which automatically inserts identifying
     information, but it can also be used where the information
     is inserted manually.

   Option
          -s   Quits after finding the first occurrence of the
               pattern in each file.

EXAMPLE
     A C program in file f.c contains the following line where
     identification information is information such as version
     number and date:

     char ident[] = "@(#)identification information";

     If f.c is compiled to yield the files f.o and a.out, the
     command what f.c f.o a.out prints the following output:

          f.c:
                  identification information

          f.o:
                  identification information

          a.out:
                  identification information

PROMPTS
   File Name(s):
