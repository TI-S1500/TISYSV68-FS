NAME
     getopt - Parses command options

SYNOPSIS
     set -- `getopt optstring $*`

DESCRIPTION
   Purpose
     The getopt command is used to break up options in command
     lines for easy parsing by shell procedures and to check for
     legal options.

   Arguments
     optstring
	  A string of recognized option letters (see getopt(3C)).
	  If a letter is followed by a colon, the option is
	  expected to have an argument which may or may not be
	  separated from it by white space.

     --   A special argument used to delimit the end of the
	  options.  If it is used explicitly, getopt recognizes
	  it.  Otherwise, getopt generates this delimiter.  In
	  either case, getopt places it at the end of the
	  options.  The shell's positional parameters ($1 $2 ...)
	  are reset so that each option is preceded by a - and is
	  in its own positional parameter.  Each option argument
	  is also parsed into its own positional parameter.

   Discussion
     The getopt command returns a string of options and option
     values terminated by --, followed by parameters that are not
     arguments.  The command stops processing after it encounters
     the first parameter that is not an option. In the example
     getopt abc -a -b frog -c, frog is the first parameter that
     is not an option. This example returns -a -b -- frog -c.  If
     -b had required a value, the result would have been
     different.  For example, getopt ab:c -a -b frog -c returns
     -a -b frog -c --.

EXAMPLES
     The following Bourne shell, sh(1), code fragment shows how
     one might process the arguments for a command that can take
     the options a or b, as well as the option o, which requires
     an argument:

     set -- `getopt abo: $*`
     if [ $? != 0 ]
     then
	      echo $USAGE
	      exit 2
     fi
     for i in $*
     do
	      case $i in
	      -a | -b)	     FLAG=$i; shift;;
	      -o)	     OARG=$2; shift 2;;
	      --)	     shift; break;;
	      esac
     done


     This code accepts any of the following as equivalent:

     cmd -aoarg file file
     cmd -a -o arg file file
     cmd -oarg -a file file
     cmd -a -oarg -- file file

     sh(1), getopt(3C).

DIAGNOSTICS
     The getopt command prints an error message on the standard
     error when it encounters an option letter not included in
     optstring.
