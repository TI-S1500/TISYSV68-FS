NAME
     lp - Sends requests to an LP print service

SYNOPSIS
     lp  [printing-options] files

     lp -i request-ids printing-options

DESCRIPTION
     The first form of the lp command arranges for the named
     files and associated information (collectively called a
     request) to be printed.  If no file names are specified on
     the command line, the standard input is assumed.  The
     standard input can be specified along with named files on
     the shell command line by using the file name(s) and - for
     the standard input.  The files will be printed in the order
     they appear on the command line.

     The second form of lp is used to change the options for a
     request.  The print request identified by the request-id is
     changed according to the printing options specified with
     this command.  The printing options available are the same
     as those with the first form of the lp command.  If the
     request has finished printing, the change is rejected.  If
     the request is already printing, it will be stopped and
     restarted from the beginning (unless the -P option has been
     given).

     lp associates a unique request-id with each request and
     prints it on the standard output.  This request-id can be
     used later to cancel, change, or find the status of the
     request.  (See cancel(1) for details about canceling a
     request, the previous paragraph for an explanation of how to
     change a request, and lpstat(1) for information about
     checking the status of a print request.)

Sending a Print Request
     The first form of the lp command is used to send a print
     request to a particular printer or group of printers.

     Options to lp must always precede file names, but can be
     listed in any order.  The following options are available
     for lp:

     -c        Make copies of the files to be printed immediately
               when lp is invoked.  Normally, files will not be
               copied.  If the -c option is not given, then the
               user should be careful not to remove any of the
               files before the request has been printed in its
               entirety.  It should also be noted that in the
               absence of the -c option, any changes made to the
               named files after the request is made but before
               it is printed will be reflected in the printed
               output.

     -d dest   Print this request using dest as the printer or
               class of printers.  Under certain conditions (lack
               of printer availability, capabilities of printers,
               and so on), requests for specific destinations may
               not be accepted (see accept(1M) and lpstat(1)).
               By default, dest is taken from the environment
               variable LPDEST (if it is set).  Otherwise, a
               default destination (if one exists) for the
               computer system is used.  Destination names vary
               from system to system (see lpstat(1)).

     -f form-name [-d any]
               Print the request on the form form-name.  The LP
               print service ensures that the form is mounted on
               the printer.  If form-name is requested with a
               printer destination that cannot support the form,
               the request is rejected.  If form-name has not
               been defined for the system or if the user is not
               allowed to use the form, the request is rejected
               (see lpforms(1M)).  When the -d any option is
               given, the request is printed on any printer that
               has the requested form mounted and can handle any
               other needs of the print request.

     -H special-handling
               Print the request according to the value of
               special-handling.  Acceptable values for special-
               handling are hold, resume, and immediate, defined
               as follows:

             hold    Do not print the request until notified.  If
                     printing has already begun, stop it.  Other
                     print requests will go ahead of a held
                     request until it is resumed.

             resume  Resume a held request.  If it had been
                     printing when held, it will be the next
                     request printed, unless subsequently bumped
                     by an immediate request.

             immediate
                     (Available only to LP administrators)
                     Print the request next.  If more than one
                     request is assigned immediate, the requests
                     are printed in the reverse order queued.  If
                     a request is currently printing on the
                     desired printer, you have to put it on hold
                     to allow the immediate request to print.

     -m        Send mail (see mail(1)) after the files have been
               printed.  By default, no mail is sent upon normal
               completion of the print request.

     -n number Print number copies of the output.  (Default is
               1.)

     -o option Specify printer-dependent or class-dependent
               option variables.  Several such options can be
               specified on a single command line either by using
               the -o keyletter more than once (i.e., -o $option
               sub 1$ -o $option sub 2$ ... -o $option sub n$),
               or by specifying a list of options with one -o
               keyletter (i.e., -o $option sub 1$, $option
               sub 2$, ... $option sub n$).  The standard
               interface recognizes the following options:

             nobanner
                   Do not print a banner page with this request.
                   (The administrator can disallow this option at
                   any time.) This option requires the use of the
                   /usr/spool/lp/model/standard interface.

             nofilebreak
                   Do not insert a form feed between the files
                   given, if submitting a job to print more than
                   one file. This option requires the use of the
                   /usr/spool/lp/model/standard interface.

             length=scaled-decimal-number
                   Print this request with pages scaled-decimal-
                   number lines long.  A scaled-decimal-number is
                   an optionally scaled decimal number that gives
                   a size in lines, columns, inches, or
                   centimeters, as appropriate.  The scale is
                   indicated by appending the letter i for
                   inches, or the letter c for centimeters.  For
                   length or width settings, an unscaled number
                   indicates lines or columns; for line pitch or
                   character pitch settings, an unscaled number
                   indicates lines per inch or characters per
                   inch (the same as a number scaled with i).
                   For example, length=66 indicates a page length
                   of 66 lines, length=11i indicates a page
                   length of 11 inches, and length=27.94c
                   indicates a page length of 27.94 centimeters.
                   This option requires the use of the
                   /usr/spool/lp/model/standard interface.

                   This option cannot be used with the -f option.

             width=scaled-decimal-number
                   Print this request with page-width set to
                   scaled-decimal-number columns wide.  (See the
                   explanation of scaled-decimal-numbers in the
                   preceding discussion of length.)  This option
                   cannot be used with the -f option. This option
                   requires the use of the
                   /usr/spool/lp/model/standard interface.

             lpi=scaled-decimal-number
                   Print this request with the line pitch set to
                   scaled-decimal-number lines per inch.  This
                   option cannot be used with the -f option. This
                   option requires the use of the
                   /usr/spool/lp/model/standard interface.

             cpi=scaled-decimal-number
                   Print this request with the character pitch
                   set to scaled-decimal-number characters per
                   inch.  Character pitch can also be set to pica
                   (representing 10 columns per inch) or elite
                   (representing 12 columns per inch), or it can
                   be compressed (representing as many columns as
                   a printer can handle).  There is no standard
                   number of columns per inch for all printers;
                   see the Terminfo database (terminfo(4)) for
                   the default character pitch for your printer.
                   This option cannot be used with the -f option.
                   This option requires the use of the
                   /usr/spool/lp/model/standard interface.

             stty=stty-option-list
                   A list of options valid for the stty command;
                   enclose the list with quotes if it contains
                   blanks. This option requires the use of the
                   /usr/spool/lp/model/standard interface.

             Note: Do not specify any stty options when printing
                   to terminal-attached printers.

     -P page-list
               Print the pages specified in page-list.  This
               option can be used only if there is a filter
               available to handle it; otherwise, the print
               request will be rejected.  The page-list can
               consist of range(s) of numbers, single page
               numbers, or a combination of both.  The pages will
               be printed in ascending order. This option
               requires the use of the
               /usr/spool/lp/model/standard interface.

     -q priority-level
               Assign this request priority-level in the printing
               queue.  The values of priority-level range from 0,
               the highest priority, to 39, the lowest priority.
               If a priority is not specified, the default for
               the print service is used, as assigned by the
               system administrator.

     -s        Suppress messages from the print service such as
               request id is request-id.

     -S character-set [-d any]

     -S print-wheel [-d any]
             Print this request using the specified character-set
             or print-wheel.  If a form was requested and it
             requires a character set or print wheel other than
             the one specified with the -S option, the request is
             rejected.  For printers that take print wheels:  if
             the print wheel specified is not one listed by the
             administrator as acceptable for the printer
             specified in this request, the request is rejected
             unless the print wheel is already mounted on the
             printer.  For printers that use selectable or
             programmable character sets:  if the character-set
             specified is not one defined in the terminfo
             database for the printer (see terminfo(4)), or is
             not an alias defined by the administrator, the
             request is rejected.  When the -d any option is
             used, the request is printed on any printer that has
             the print wheel mounted or any printer that can
             select the character set, and that can handle any
             other needs of the request.

     -t title
             Print title on the banner page of the output.  The
             default is no title.

     -T content-type [-r]
             Print the request on a printer that can support the
             specified content-type.  If no printer accepts this
             type directly, a filter will be used to convert the
             content into an acceptable type.  If the -r option
             is specified, a filter will not be used.  If -r is
             specified, but no printer accepts the content-type
             directly, the request is rejected.  If the content-
             type is not acceptable to any printer, either
             directly or with a filter, the request is rejected.

     -w      Write a message on the user's terminal after the
             files have been printed.  If the user is not logged
             in, mail will be sent instead.

     -y mode-list
             Print this request according to the printing modes
             listed in mode-list.  The allowed values for mode-
             list are locally defined.  This option can be used
             only if there is a filter available to handle it;
             otherwise, the print request will be rejected.

NOTES
     Printers for which requests are not being accepted will not
     be considered when the destination is any.  (Use the lpstat
     -a command to see which printers are accepting requests.)
     On the other hand, if a request is destined for a class of
     printers and the class itself is accepting requests, all
     printers in the class will be considered, regardless of
     their acceptance status, as long as the printer class is
     accepting requests.

WARNING
     For printers that take mountable print wheels or font
     cartridges, if you do not specify a particular print wheel
     or font with the -S option, whichever one happens to be
     mounted at the time your request is printed will be used.
     Use the lpstat -p printer -l command to see which print
     wheels are available on a particular printer, or the lpstat
     -S -l command to find out what print wheels are available
     and on which printers.  For printers that have selectable
     character sets, you will get the standard character set if
     you do not use the -S option.
