SYNOPSIS

DESCRIPTION
     tde provides a means for the user to define the
     characteristics of the terminal to be used with pm(1T). pm

     environmental symbol. tde maintains an ASCII file containing
     all terminal types supported by pm. This file may be updated
     using either tde or a standard editor such as vi(1). Each
     terminal description contains escape codes and characters
     required for the pm screen display.
