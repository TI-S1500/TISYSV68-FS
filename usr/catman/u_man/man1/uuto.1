UUTO(1C)                                                 UUTO(1C)

NAME
     uuto - Creates a public UNIX system-to-UNIX system file copy

SYNOPSIS
     uuto -mp source-files destination

DESCRIPTION
   Purpose
     The uuto command sends source-files from the local system to
     destination on the remote system.

   Options
     -m   Sends mail to the sender when the copy is complete.

     -p   Copies the source file into the spool directory before
          transmission.

   Discussion
     The command uses the uucp(1C) facility to send files,
     allowing the local system to control file access.  A
     source-filename is a path name on the user's machine.
     Destination has the following form:

     system!user

     The system argument is taken from a list of system names
     that uucp recognizes (see uuname(1C)) and user is the login
     name of someone on the specified system.

     The files (or subtrees if directories are specified) are
     sent to PUBDIR on system, where PUBDIR is a public directory
     defined in the uucp source.  Specifically, the files are
     sent to the following destination:

     PUBDIR/receive/user/mysystem/files

     The destined recipient is notified by mail(1) of the arrival
     of files.

EXAMPLE
     The following example sends files named filea, fileb, and
     filec to user kk on system sys1.  A message is sent by mail
     to the sender when the copy is complete.

          uuto -pm filea fileb filec sys1!kk

PROMPTS
   Source System! Path Name(s):
     Enter the path name you want to send. The path name can be
     preceded by a system name or by ~ or ~/user.  You can send
     more than one source path name at a time.

   Destination System! Path Name:
     Enter the path name of the destination. The path name can be
     preceded by a system name or by ~ or ~/user.

   Notify Sender:
     The initial value is no.  Enter yes to send mail to the
     requester when the copy is complete.

   Copy to Spool Directory:
     Initial value is no.  If you enter yes, the source file is
     copied into the spool directory before transmission.

     If you have problems, check the files under /usr/lib/uucp
     and delete any /usr/spool/uucp/LCK..(tty-device) files.

FILES
     /usr/spool/uucppublic       Public directory(PUBDIR)
