RDFLUSH(1T)                                           RDFLUSH(1T)

NAME
     rdflush - Copies to a disk file system the RAM disk files
     marked as flushable in the RAM disk list (/etc/rdlist)

SYNOPSIS
     rdflush -df

DESCRIPTION
   Purpose
     The RAM disk list contains a list of path names to files in
     the hard disk file system. Each entry may be optionally
     preceded with a colon (:)  indicating that the file is to be
     flushed to the entry from the corresponding RAM disk file
     system path name (which is identical to the entry prefixed
     by the RAM disk mount point-for example, /ram), whenever
     rdflush is executed.

   Options
     -ddir
          Identifies an alternate RAM disk file system mount
          point directory. The default is /ram.

     -ffile
          Identifies alternate RAM disk list. The default file is
          /etc/rdlist.

   Discussion
     The RAM disk must be mounted before the rdflush utility can
     be used.

     All necessary directories will be created on real disk
     during a copy if they are not already present.

     The rdflush utility terminates after all flushable entries
     in the RAM disk list have been copied from the RAM disk to
     the real disk file system.

FILES
     /etc/rdlist
     /etc/rdflscr

DIAGNOSTICS
     An error will be returned if the rdlist file is not found or
     is in the wrong format or if a copy fails.
