LORDER(1)                                               LORDER(1)

NAME
     lorder - Finds ordering relation for an object library

SYNOPSIS
     lorder files

DESCRIPTION
   Purpose
     The lorder program orders object file names in pairs in
     which the first name in the pair identifies a file that
     refers to external identifiers defined in the second name in
     the pair.

   Discussion
     The input is one or more object or library archive files
     (see ar(1)).  The standard output is a list of pairs of
     object file names.

     The output may be processed by tsort(1) to find an ordering
     of a library suitable for one-pass access by ld(1).  Note
     that the link editor ld is capable of multiple passes over
     an archive in the portable archive format (see ar(4)) and
     does not require that lorder be used when building an
     archive.  The usage of the lorder command, however, may
     allow for slightly more efficient access of the archive
     during the link edit process.

EXAMPLE
     The following example builds a new library from existing .o
     files.

          ar cr library 'lorder *.o | tsort'

     The following simple example orders object files a.o, b.o,
     and c.o and puts the ordered listing in a file named order:

          lorder a.o b.o c.o > order

FILES
     *symref, *symdef    temporary files

SEE ALSO
     ar(1), ar(4), ld(1), tsort(1).

NOTES
     Object files whose names do not end with .o, even when
     contained in library archives, are overlooked.  Their global
     symbols and references are attributed to some other file.
