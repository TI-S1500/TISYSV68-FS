UUCLEAN(1M)                                           UUCLEAN(1M)

NAME
     uuclean - Provides maintenance on the uucp(1C) spool
     directory

SYNOPSIS
     uuclean -dmnpsw

DESCRIPTION
   Purpose
     The uuclean command scans the spool directory for files with
     the specified prefix and deletes all those older than the
     specified number of hours.  This command is typically
     started by cron(1M).

   Options
     -ddirectory  Cleans directory instead of the spool
                  directory.

     -mfile       Sends mail to the owner of each file when it is
                  deleted.  If file is specified, then an entry
                  is placed in file.

     -ntime       Deletes files whose age is more than time
                  hours, if the prefix test specified with the -p
                  option is satisfied.  The default time is 72
                  hours.

     -ppre        Scans for files with pre as the file prefix.
                  Up to 10 -p arguments can be specified.  A -p
                  without any pre causes all files older than the
                  time specified with the -n option to be
                  deleted.

     -ssys        Examines only files destined for system sys.
                  Up to 10 -s arguments can be specified.

     -wfile       Finds files older than time hours and prints a
                  warning message. The files are not deleted.  If
                  the argument file is present, the warning is
                  placed in file.  Otherwise, the warnings go to
                  the standard output.

EXAMPLE
     The following example will remove lock files (LCK..)  and
     status file (ST.) which are older than 2 hours.

     /usr/lib/uucp/uuclean -pLCK -pST -n2

     Lock files and status files left in the /usr/spool/uucp
     directory are usually the result of a uucp(1C) or CU(1C)
     session failure.

PROMPTS
   Scan for files with prefix:
     Enter a file prefix. The uuclean command scans the spool
     directory for files with this file prefix.

   Delete files older than hour:
     Response to this prompt is optional.  Enter a number for
     hours. The default is 72 hours.  If the prefix test
     specified with the previous prompt is satisfied, the command
     deletes files whose age is greater than the specified hours.

   Notify owner of deleted file:
     Initial value is yes.  Enter a yes to send mail to the owner
     of the file when the file is deleted.  Enter no to prevent
     sending mail when the file is deleted.

FILES
     /usr/lib/uucp    Directory with commands used by uuclean
                      internally
     /usr/spool/uucp  Spool directory
