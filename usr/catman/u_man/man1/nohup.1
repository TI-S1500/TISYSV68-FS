NOHUP(1)                                                 NOHUP(1)

NAME
     nohup - Runs a command immune to hangups and quits

SYNOPSIS
     nohup command [arguments]

DESCRIPTION
     The nohup command executes command with hangups and quits
     ignored.  (These are not stty(1) quits.)

     If output is not redirected by the user, it is sent to the
     file named nohup.out.  If nohup.out is not writable in the
     current directory, output is redirected to $HOME/nohup.out.

EXAMPLES
     The nohup command is useful with pipelines or lists of
     commands.  Pipelines and lists of commands can be placed in
     a single file, called a shell procedure. The following
     example applies nohup to everything in the file procfile .

          nohup sh procfile

     If the shell procedure procfile is to be executed often, the
     need to type sh can be eliminated by giving procfile execute
     permission.  Add an ampersand to execute the contents of
     procfile in background with interrupts ignored (see sh(1)).

          nohup procfile &
