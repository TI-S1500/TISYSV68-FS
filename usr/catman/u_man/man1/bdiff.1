BDIFF(1)                                                 BDIFF(1)

NAME
     bdiff - Compares files too large for diff

SYNOPSIS
     bdiff file1 file2 n -s

DESCRIPTION
   Purpose
     The bdiff command is used in a manner analogous to diff(1)
     to find which lines must be changed in two files to bring
     them into agreement.  Its purpose is to allow processing of
     files that are too large for diff.

   Options
     If you specify both options, they must appear in the order
     shown in the Synopsis.

     n    The bdiff command ignores lines common to the beginning
          of both files, splits the remainder of each file into
          n-line segments, and invokes diff upon corresponding
          segments.  The value of n is 3500 by default.  If the
          optional third argument is given, and it is numeric, it
          is used as the value for n.  This is useful in those
          cases in which 3500-line segments are too large for
          diff, causing it to fail.

     -s   Specifies that no diagnostic messages are to be printed
          by bdiff.  Note, however, that this does not suppress
          possible messages from diff.

   Discussion
     If file1 or file2 is -, the standard input is read.

     The output of bdiff is exactly that of diff, with line
     numbers adjusted to account for the segmenting of the files
     (that is, to make it look as if the files had been processed
     whole).  Note that because of the segmenting of the files,
     bdiff does not necessarily find a smallest sufficient set of
     file differences.

PROMPTS
   File 1:
     Enter the name of the first file to compare.

   File 2:
     Enter the name of the second file to compare.

   Output File Name:
     Response to this prompt is optional.  Enter a file name to
     receive the output of the command.

   Segment Length:
     The initial value is 3500.  Enter the number of lines into
     which the command divides the files for processing by the
     diff command.

   Print Diagnostics:
     The initial value is yes.  Enter yes to allow the command to
     print diagnostic messages.
