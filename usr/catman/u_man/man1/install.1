INSTALL(1M)                                           INSTALL(1M)

NAME
     install - Installs commands and files

SYNOPSIS
     install -cfinmugos file [directories]

DESCRIPTION
   Purpose
     The install command is most commonly used in makefiles (see
     make(1)) to install a file (updated target file) in a
     specific place within a file system.

   Options
     -c  dira       Installs a new command (file) in the
                    directory specified by dira only if file is
                    not found.  If it is found, install issues a
                    message saying that the file already exists
                    and exits without overwriting it.  Can be
                    used alone or with the -s option.

     -f  dirb       Forces file to be installed in a given
                    directory, regardless of whether one already
                    exists. If the file being installed does not
                    already exist, the mode and owner of the new
                    file is set to 755 and bin, respectively. If
                    the file already exists, the mode and owner
                    is that of the already existing file. Can be
                    used alone or with the -o or -s options.

     -i             Ignores the default directory list, searching
                    through only the given directories (dirx
                    ...).  Can be used alone or with options
                    other than -c and -f.

     -n  dirc       Puts file in the directory dirc if file is
                    not found in any of the searched directories.
                    The mode and owner of the new file is set to
                    755 and bin, respectively.  Can be used alone
                    or with options other than -c and -f.

     -m mode        The mode of the new file is set to mode.
                    Only available to the super-user.

     -u user        The owner of the new file is set to user.
                    Only available to the super-user.

     -g group       The group ID of the new file is set to group.
                    Only available to the super-user.

     -o             Saves a found file by copying it to OLDfile
                    in the directory in which it was found.  This
                    option is useful when installing a normally
                    busy file such as /bin/sh or /etc/getty,
                    where the existing file cannot be removed.
                    Can be used alone or with options other than
                    -c.

     -s             Suppresses printing of messages other than
                    error messages.  Can be used alone or with
                    any other options.

   Discussion
     Each file is installed by copying it into the appropriate
     directory, thereby retaining the mode and owner of the
     original command.  The program prints messages telling the
     user exactly what files it is replacing or creating and
     where they are going.

     If no options or directories (dirx ...)  are given, install
     searches a set of default directories (/bin, /usr/bin, /etc,
     /lib, and /usr/lib, in that order) for a file with the same
     name as file.  When the first occurrence is found, install
     issues a message saying that it is overwriting that file
     with file, and proceeds to do so.  If the file is not found,
     the program sends a message to the user and exits without
     further action.

     If directories (dirx ...)  are specified after file, they
     are searched before the directories specified in the default
     list.

     The options -m, -u, and -g can only be used with the options
     -f, -c, and -n.  Otherwise, the mode, owner, or group will
     not be changed. The options also only work when installing a
     file that does not already exist. If a file is being
     replaced, the owner, group, and mode will always remain the
     same as the original file's owner, group, and mode.
