TEE(1)                                                     TEE(1)

NAME
     tee - Writes both to standard output and to specified files

SYNOPSIS
     tee -ai [files]

DESCRIPTION
   Purpose
     The tee command transcribes the standard input to the
     standard output and makes copies in the files.  The files
     are created if they do not already exist.  If the files
     already exist, they are overwritten unless the -a option is
     specified.

   Options
     -i   Ignores interrupts.

     -a   Causes the output to be appended to the files rather
          than overwriting them.

EXAMPLE
     The following command appends the output of the ls(1)
     command to the file named myfile and prints the output of ls
     to the standard output:

          ls -l | tee -a myfile
