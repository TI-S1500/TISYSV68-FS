UUPICK(1C)                                             UUPICK(1C)

NAME
     uupick - Picks uuto(1C) files

SYNOPSIS
     uupick -s

DESCRIPTION
   Purpose
     The uupick command accepts or rejects the files transmitted
     to the user by the uuto(1C) command.

   Option
     -ssystem
          Searches the PUBDIR for files sent from system only.

   Discussion
     The command searches PUBDIR for files destined for the user.
     For each entry (file or directory) found, the following
     message is printed on the standard output:

     from system: [file file-name] [directory dirname]
     ?

     The user enters one of the following commands, which uupick
     then reads from the standard input to determine the
     disposition of the file:

     newline    Goes on to next entry

     d          Deletes the entry

     m [ dir ]  Moves the entry to named directory dir with the
                current directory as the default

     a [ dir ]  Performs the same task as m except that all the
                files sent from system are moved

     p          Prints the contents of the file

     q          Stops and exits.

     CTRL-d     Performs same task as q

     !command   Escapes to the shell to do command

     *          Prints a command summary

PROMPTS
   Search PUBDIR for User or System
     Enter u or s to to search the PUBDIR for files destined to
     the user or the system, respectively.  (PUBDIR is
     /usr/spool/uucppublic.)

   System Name:
     Enter the name of a system.  The command searches the PUBDIR
     for files sent from this system.

     Once these prompts are answered, the following message is
     printed on standard output for each file found:

          from system: [file file-name] [directory dirname]
          ?

     The uupick command then waits for the user to enter one of
     the previously described commands to determine the
     disposition of the file.
