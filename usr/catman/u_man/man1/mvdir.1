NAME
     mvdir - Renames directories

SYNOPSIS
     mvdir dirname  name

DESCRIPTION
     The mvdir command renames directories within a file system
     if name does not exist.  The dirname argument must be a
     directory.  Neither dirname nor name can be a subset of the
     other.  (/x/y cannot be moved to /x/y/z, and /x/y/z cannot
     be moved to /x/y.)  If name is the name of an existing
     directory, dirname is made a subdirectory of name.  If and
     only if name does not exist, name is the new name of
     dirname.  Only the super-user can use mvdir.
