KIFTISAM(1T)					       KIFTISAM(1T)

NAME
     kiftisam - Converts key-indexed files to their T-ISAM
     equivalents

SYNOPSIS
     kiftisam

DESCRIPTION
   Purpose
     The kiftisam command converts TI Business System 300, 600,
     and 800 key-indexed files (KIFs) to TI System 1000 Series
     indexed sequential access method (T-ISAM) files.

     This command is not available as a command string.

   Discussion
     The kiftisam command builds the T-ISAM file based on the key
     masks and the data records of the KIF.  The user provides
     these attributes by executing the 990 commands Map Key-
     Indexed File (MKF) and Copy KIF to Sequential File (CKS).
     The KIF is the input file for MKF and CKS.  The output of
     MKF and CKS is transported to the System 1000 Series
     machine.  The kiftisam command is executed to generate a T-
     ISAM file with characteristics similar to the KIF using the
     MKF and CKS files as inputs.

EXAMPLE
     After the CKS and MKF files are transported to the System 1000 Series
     machine, the user executes the following kiftisam command to produce a
     T-ISAM file:

	  kiftisam

     Responses to the following prompts are indicated to the
     right of the colons:

     MKF filename: /usr/joe/mkf
     CKS filename: /usr/joe/cks
     T-ISAM filename: /usr/joe/data
     Binary data?: n
     T-ISAM maximum record length: 120

     The result of these responses is a T-ISAM file pair named
     /usr/joe/data.dat and /usr/joe/data.idx generated from the
     KIF.
