ECHO(1)                                                   ECHO(1)

NAME
     echo - Echoes arguments

SYNOPSIS
     echo arguments

DESCRIPTION
   Purpose
     The echo command writes its arguments on the standard
     output.  The arguments are separated by blanks and
     terminated by a newline.

   Discussion
     This command understands C-like escape conventions.  To
     force echo to interpret the following characters, use single
     or double quotes around the characters or around the entire
     echo argument.

     \b   Backspaces

     \c   Suppresses newline (This is useful in a shell script to
          print a prompt and leave the cursor at the end of the
          prompt.)

     \f   Formfeed

     \n   Inserts a newline

     \r   Inserts a carriage return

     \t   Inserts a tab

     \\   Inserts a backslash

     \n   Inserts the 8-bit character whose ASCII code is the 1-,
          2- or 3-digit octal number n, which must start with a
          zero (Hexadecimal format is not supported.)

     The echo command is useful for producing diagnostic messages
     in command files and for sending known data into a pipe.

EXAMPLE
     The following example creates a directory called
     testresults.  Text is placed into the file named test1 using
     the echo command.  Text that normally appears on the
     standard output is redirected to the file.

          mkdir testresults
          cd testresults
          echo April 30, 1986 '\n'Results of test 1: > test1

     File test1 is created with the following lines:

          April 30, 1986
          Results of test 1

SEE ALSO
     sh(1).

NOTES
     This is not the same echo command as the built-in echo of
     the bsh(1).
