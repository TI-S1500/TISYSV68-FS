NAME
     who - Provides information about users and system activity

SYNOPSIS
     who -AabdHlpqrstTu [file]

     who am i

DESCRIPTION
   Purpose
     With no options, the who command lists the user's name,
     terminal line, and login time for each current system user. 

   Options
     With options, who lists logins, logoffs, reboots, and
     changes to the system clock, as well as other processes
     spawned by the init(1M) process.

     -A   Displays limited accounting information, but only if
	  you specify /etc/wtmp for file.

     -a   Processes /etc/utmp or the named file with the Abdlprtu
	  options turned on.

     -b   Indicates the time and date of the last reboot.

     -d   Displays all processes that have expired and have not
	  been respawned by init.  The exit field appears for
	  dead processes and contains the termination and exit
	  values (as returned by wait(2)), of the dead process.
	  This can be useful in determining why a process
	  terminated.

     -H   Prints column headings above the regular output.

     -l   Lists only those lines on which the system is waiting
	  for someone to login.  The name field is LOGIN in such
	  cases.  Other fields are the same as for user entries
	  except that the state field does not exist.

     -p   Lists any other process that is currently active and
	  has been previously spawned by init.	The name field of
	  who output is the name of the program executed by init
	  as found in the file named /etc/inittab .  The state,
	  line, and activity fields have no meaning.  The comment
	  field shows the id field of the line from script stored
	  in the file named /etc/inittab that spawned this
	  process.  See inittab(4).  See -u and -T options for
	  field descriptions.

     -q   A quick who displays the names and number of users
	  currently logged on. When this option is used, all
	  other options are ignored.

     -r   Indicates the current run-level of the init process.
	  Following the run-level and date information are three
	  fields that indicate the current state, the number of
	  times that state was previously entered, and the
	  previous state.

     -s   Lists only the name, line and time fields; this is the
	  default.

     -t   Indicates the last change to the system clock (via the
	  date(1) command) by root.  See su(1).

     -T   Prints the state of the terminal line.  The state
	  describes whether someone else can write to that
	  terminal.  A + appears if the terminal is writable by
	  anyone; a - appears if it is not.  Root can write to
	  all lines having a + or a - in the state field.  If a
	  bad line is encountered, a ? is printed.

     -u   Lists information about those users who are currently
	  logged in.  The information consists of the following
	  entries:

	    name   The user's login name.

	    line   The name of the line as found in the directory
		   named /dev.

	    time   The time that the user logged in.

	    activity
		   The number of hours and minutes since activity
		   last occurred on that particular line.  A dot
		   (.)	indicates that the terminal has seen
		   activity in the last minute and is therefore
		   current.  If more than 24 hours have elapsed
		   or the line has not been used since boot time,
		   the entry is marked old.

	    pid    The process ID of the user's shell.

	    comment
		   The comment field associated with this line as
		   found in directory named /etc/inittab (see
		   inittab(4)).  This file can contain
		   information such as the location of the
		   terminal, the telephone number of the dataset,
		   and the terminal type if hardwired.

   Discussion
     The command examines the /etc/utmp file to obtain its
     information.  If file is given, that file is examined.
     Usually, file is the file named /etc/wtmp, which contains a
     history of all the logins since the file was last created.

     The who command with the am i option identifies the invoking
     user.

     Except for the default -s option, the general format for
     output entries is as follows:

     name [state] line time activity pid [comment] [exit]

EXAMPLE
     The command who -bu results in a display similar to the
     following:

		   system boot	Feb 13 13:24
	  jim	   tty0 	Feb 25 08:10   .       25566
	  michael  tty4 	Feb 24 08:47   16:51   23248

     The system was booted on February 13 at 13:24.  User jim,
     terminal line tty0, logged on February 25 at 08:10 and is
     currently active.	The user's shell process ID is 25566.
     User michael, terminal line tty4, logged on February 24 at
     08:47.  It has been 16 hours and 51 minutes since activity
     last occurred on line tty4.  The user's shell process ID is
     23248.
