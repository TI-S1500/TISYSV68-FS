VAL(1)                                                     VAL(1)

NAME
     val - Validates an SCCS file

SYNOPSIS
     val -
     val -mrsy files

DESCRIPTION
   Purpose
     The val command determines if the specified file is an SCCS
     file that meets the characteristics specified by the options
     and arguments.

   Options
     Options for val can appear in any order.  The effects of any
     option apply independently to each named file on the command
     line.  The options are as follows:

     -       Causes reading of the standard input until an end-
             of-file condition is detected.  Each line read is
             independently processed as if it were a command line
             argument list.

     -mname  The argument value name is compared with the SCCS
             %M% keyword in file.

     -rSID   The argument value SCCS identification (SID) sring
             is an SCCS delta number.  A check is made to
             determine if the SID is ambiguous or invalid.  For
             example, r1 is ambiguous because it physically does
             not exist but implies 1.1, 1.2, and so on, which
             might exist.  Also, r1.0 or r1.1.0 is invalid
             because neither can exist as a valid delta number.
             If the SID is valid and not ambiguous, a check is
             made to determine if it actually exists.

     -s      Silences the diagnostic message normally generated
             on the standard output for any error detected while
             processing each named file on a given command line.

     -ytype  The argument value type is compared with the SCCS
             %Y% keyword in file.

EXAMPLE
     The following command reads the standard input to process
     two command lines.  The first command line verifies that the
     SCCS file s.file1 has the type flag value c and the module
     name flag value abc.  After val has processed s.file1, file2
     is checked for the type flag d and the module name flag
     value xyz.

          val -
          -yc -mabc s.file1
          -yd -mxyz w.file2

PROMPTS
   Input File Name(s):
     Enter the names of the files to process.

   SCCS Delta Version Number:
     Optional string.  Enter the SID of the delta to process.

   Supress Output:
     The initial value is no.  Enter yes to suppress the
     diagnostic messages for errors.

   Name to Compare With VAL.pr:
     Optional. Enter the name of a file to compare with the SCCS
     %M% keyword in the file specified in the Input File Name:
     prompt.

   Type for File Comparison:
     Optional. Enter a value to compare with the SCCS %Y% keyword
     in the file specified in the Input File Name: prompt.

DIAGNOSTICS
     Use help(1) for explanations.

NOTES
     The val command can process up to 50 files on a single
     command line.  Any number above 50 produces a core dump.
