SADSP(1T)						SADSP(1T)

NAME
     sadsp - Invokes a system activity display

SYNOPSIS
     sadsp

DESCRIPTION
   Purpose
     The sadsp command displays system performance statistics.
     The environment variable TERM must be set to reflect the
     current terminal type because the command uses the termcap
     library to control the screen.

   Discussion
     When sadsp is invoked the screen is cleared and a display
     similar to the following is shown:

     The display is updated every two seconds.	Press the F1
     (function key 1) key to reinitialize the display.	Press the
     F2 (function key 2) key to terminate the display.	Because
     the counters are sampled at specific intervals, the
     percentages in the display are estimates.

     The following list describes the meanings of the field
     descriptors.

     CPUs
	  Number of CPUs currently active in the system.

     CCBs
	  Number of communication carrier boards (CCBs) currently
	  active in the system.

     Ticks
	  Number of clock ticks that have elapsed since the
	  display was initialized.

     Swap Avail
	  Amount of swap space (in K bytes) available to the system.

     Swap Free
	  Amount of swap space (in K bytes) that is currently free of use.

     Proc Swapped
	  Number of processes currently swapped.

     Proc Migr
	  Number of processes that have been migrated to an
	  alternate CPU.

     Proc Forks
	  Number of process forks.

     Logical I/O
	  Number of disk block requests issued to the file
	  management subsystem.

     Actual I/O
	  Number of disk I/O requests issued by the file
	  management subsystem.

     Phys I/O
	  Number of raw device I/O requests issued.

     Ram disk reads
	  Number of read requests issued to the RAM disk.

     Ram disk writes
	  Number of write requests issued to the RAM disk.

     Ave. size
	  Average size (in K bytes) of the read or write requests to RAM disk.

     Pct. idle
	  Percent of time a particular CPU is idle.

     Mem avail
	  Amount of memory (in pages) available on the particular CPU.

     Mem free
	  Amount of memory (in pages) currently free on the particular CPU.

     # of proc
	  Number of processes currently executing on this CPU.

     # of clns
	  Number of clones (in memory copies) currently executing
	  on this CPU.

     # of proc sw.
	  Number of process switches by this CPU.

     Paging disk I/O
	  Number of disk I/O requests issued by the virtual
	  memory subsystem to facilitate paging for this CPU.

     Swapping disk I/O
	  Number of disk I/O requests issued to perform swapping
	  for this CPU.

     CCB ops
	  Number of operation that have occurred on this CCB.

     CCB reads
	  Number of reads issued to this CCB.

     CCB writes
	  Number of writes issued to this CCB.

     CCB ioctls
	  Number of ioctl(2) calls issued to this CCB.

     Disk reads
	  Number of reads issued to this disk.

     Disk writes
