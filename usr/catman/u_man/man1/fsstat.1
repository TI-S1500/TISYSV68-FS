NAME
     fsstat - Reports the file system status

SYNOPSIS
     /etc/fsstat special_file

DESCRIPTION
     fsstat reports on the status of the file system on
     special_file.  During startup, this command is used to
     determine if the file system needs checking before it is
     mounted.  fsstat succeeds if the file system is unmounted
     and appears okay.  For the root file system, it succeeds if
     the file system is active and not marked bad.

SEE ALSO
     fs(4).

DIAGNOSTICS
     The command has the following exit codes:

          0 - The file system is not mounted and appears okay,
               (except for root where 0 means mounted and okay).
          1 - The file system is not mounted and needs to be checked.
          2 - The file system is mounted.
          3 - The command failed.
