ASA(1)                                                     ASA(1)

NAME
     asa - Interprets ASA carriage control characters

SYNOPSIS
     asa files

DESCRIPTION
   Purpose
     The asa command interprets the output of programs that
     utilize ASA carriage control characters.  It processes
     either the files whose names are given as arguments or the
     standard input if no file names are supplied.

   Discussion
     The first character of each line is assumed to be a control
     character.  Control character meanings are:

     ' '     (blank) Single newline before printing

     0       Double newline before printing

     1       New page before printing

     +       Overprint previous line

     Lines beginning with other than the above characters are
     treated as if they began with ' '.  The first character of a
     line is not printed.  If any such lines appear, an
     appropriate message appears on standard error.  This program
     forces the first line of each input file to start on a new
     page.

EXAMPLES
     To correctly view the output of programs that use ASA
     carriage control characters, use asa as a filter.  In this
     example, the output, properly formatted and paginated, is
     directed to the line printer:

           a.out | asa | lp

     Output sent to a file can be viewed as follows:

          asa file
