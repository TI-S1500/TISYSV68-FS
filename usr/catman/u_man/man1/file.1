FILE(1)                                                   FILE(1)

NAME
     file - Determines file type

SYNOPSIS
     file -c [-m]
     file -fm files

DESCRIPTION
   Purpose
     The file command performs a series of tests on each argument
     files in an attempt to classify it.

     If an argument appears to be ASCII, file examines the first
     512 bytes and tries to guess its language.

     The file command uses the file /etc/magic to identify files
     that have a magic number, that is, any file containing a
     numeric or string constant that indicates its type.
     Commentary at the beginning of /etc/magic explains the
     format of /etc/magic.

   Options
     -c   Causes file to check the magic file for format errors.
          For reasons of efficiency, this validation is not
          normally carried out.  If this option is used, no file
          typing is done; that is, any specified file names are
          ignored except for the name of an alternate magic file.
          When the -c option is used, file's output consists of
          error messages and status information about the
          contents of the magic file. The format and meaning of
          this status information is purposely not documented and
          is subject to change in future revisions.

     -ffile
          The next argument is taken to be a file containing the
          names of the files to be examined.

     -mfile
          The next argument is taken to be an alternate magic
          file.

EXAMPLES
     The following example determines the type of file prog3.

          file prog3

     The output of the command might be similar to the following:

          prog3:       V/68 object not stripped

PROMPTS

   Output File Name:
     Response to this prompt is optional.  Enter a file name to
