KILL(1)                                                   KILL(1)

NAME
     kill - Terminates a process

SYNOPSIS
     kill -signo PIDs

DESCRIPTION
   Purpose
     The kill command sends the specified signal number (signo)
     to the process whose process ID is PID.  This command is
     normally used to terminate processes.

   Options
     Options for kill consist of signal numbers.  See the
     signal(2) command for signal numbers and their descriptions.

     The default option is -15, which is the terminate-process
     signal.

   Discussion
     The process number of each asynchronous process started in
     background (with &) is reported by the shell (unless more
     than one process is started in a pipeline, in which case the
     number of the last process in the pipeline is reported).
     Process numbers can also be found by using ps(1).

     The details of the termination process are described in
     kill(2).  For example, if process number 0 is specified, all
     processes in the process group are signaled.

     The killed process must belong to the current user unless
     that person is the super-user.

EXAMPLE
     In the following example, the user's terminal is hung; the
     user needs to kill the process that is hanging or kill the
     shell process.  The user logs on to a different terminal
     using his or her login name.  The user executes a ps command
     to find his or her shell process ID (PID).  His or her shell
     PID is 1007.  The user then enters the following command:

          kill -9 1007

     The user now must login again.

PROMPTS

     The initial value is 15.  Enter the signal number to send to
     the specified process.

   Process ID Number(s):
