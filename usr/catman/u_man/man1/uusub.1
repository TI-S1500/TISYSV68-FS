     The uusub command defines a uucp(1) subnetwork and monitors
     the connection and traffic among the members of the
     subnetwork.  The following command is typically started by
     cron(1M) once a day:

          uusub -c all -u 24

     /usr/spool/uucp/SYSLOG.  You can also use the command uustat

     uucp administrator.

     -asys   Adds the system sys to the subnetwork.

     -csys   Exercises the connection to the system sys.  If sys
