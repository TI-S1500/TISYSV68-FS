GETF(1T)                                                 GETF(1T)

NAME
     getf - Retrieves files from a remote system via uucp(1C)

SYNOPSIS
     getf srcfile sitename destfile
     getf srcfile all destfile
     getf sitename

DESCRIPTION
   Purpose
     The getf command copies files, srcfile, located on the
     remote system, sitename, to the file, destfile, on the local
     system.

   Discussion
     Prior to invoking uucp to perform the file transfer, getf
     performs preliminary checks to ensure that lock files do not
     currently exist, that the remote system is currently
     defined, and that other checks are valid (such as ensuring
     that the file or directory is valid and readable).  If the
     all parameter is specified instead of a site name, the uucp
     daemon uucico(1C) is activated to perform all work files
     currently queued for execution.  If only the site name
     parameter is specified, uucico contacts the system,
     sitename, and performs all work requests queued at the local
     and remote sites concerning the two systems.

FILES
     /usr/spool/uucp
                   Spool directory

     /usr/lib/uucp/*
                   uucp configuration and program files

SEE ALSO
     uucico(1C), uucp(1C).

DIAGNOSTICS
     Messages are displayed to inform the user that certain lock
     or status files are being removed.  Other messages are
     displayed to inform the user of error or success conditions
     in queueing or activation of the uucp daemon.

NOTES
     If uucico is not currently active when getf is activated,
     all lock and status files for the device and system being
     accessed will be removed.  If uucico is active, the request
     will be queued for execution.

     To verify that the specified files were transferred, inspect
     the uucp log file, /usr/spool/uucp/LOGFILE.
