UPDATE(1M)                                             UPDATE(1M)

NAME
     update - Periodically updates the super block

SYNOPSIS
     update -ft

DESCRIPTION
     The update command executes the sync(2) system call every
     few seconds as specified by -t.  The default value is 30
     seconds.  This ensures that the file system is relatively
     current in case of a crash.  This command should not be
     executed directly, but should be executed out of the
     initialization shell command rc, which is called by inittab.

   Options
     -f filename
          Specifies a path name for a file containing a list of
          files that are used frequently and that update is to
          open. Having update open the files causes the inodes
          for the files to remain in memory until update
          terminates (when shutdown is done.) The update utility
          does not do any input/output to the files; it only
          opens the files.  This causes opens by other programs
          to be faster for those files because the inode does not
          need to be read from disk.
          The format of the file is as follows:

          + Lines that are totally blank or have a pound sign (#)
            in column 1 are ignored. This allows comments to be
            added as desired.

          + Each file path name specified must begin in column 1
            and be terminated by a carriage return character.
            Path names must not exceed 254 characters.

          + A maximum of 99 file path names can be specified.

     -t delay-time
          Specifies how many seconds the update utility should
          delay between sync() system calls.

SEE ALSO
     init(1M), sync(2), sync(1).

NOTES
     If the update utility encounters any error in opening a
     file, the error is totally ignored. Because update should be
     started by the rc script, there is no terminal on which to
     report errors. Additionally, the opening of files is only a
     performance optimization and is not necessary for correct
     operation of the system. The fuser utility can be used to
     check whether update successfully opened a file.

     The cband parameters "open file table size" and "inode table
     size" may need to be increased if you have update open many
     files.
