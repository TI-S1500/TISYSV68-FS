WRITE(1)                                                 WRITE(1)

NAME
     write - Writes to another user

SYNOPSIS
     write user [line]

DESCRIPTION
   Purpose
     The write command copies lines from your terminal to that of
     another user.

   Discussion
     When first called, write sends to the intended recipient the
     following message:

     Message from yourname (tty??)  [ date ]...

     When the command has successfully completed the connection,
     it sends a bell to your terminal to indicate that what you
     are typing is being sent.

     The recipient of the message can write back at this point.
     Communication continues until an end-of-file signal is read
     from the terminal or an interrupt is sent.  At that point
     write writes EOT on the other terminal and exits.

     If you want to write to a user who is logged in on more than
     one line, the line argument can be used to indicate which
     line or terminal is to be connected; otherwise, the first
     instance of the user found in the file /etc/utmp is assumed,
     and the following message is posted:

     user is logged on more than one place.
      You are connected to terminal.
      Other locations are:
     terminal

     Permission to write can be denied or granted by use of the
     mesg(1) command.  Writing to others is normally allowed by
     default.  Certain commands, in particular pr(1), disallow
     messages in order to prevent interference with their output.
     However, if the user has super-user permissions, messages
     can be forced onto a write-inhibited terminal.

     If the character ! is found at the beginning of a line,
     write calls the shell to execute the rest of the line as a
     command.

     The following protocol is suggested for using write:  when
     you first write to another user, wait for the recipient to
     write back before starting to send.  Each person should end
     a message with a distinctive signal (such as (o) for over)
     so that the other person knows when to reply.  The signal
     (oo) (for over and out) is suggested when conversation is
     finished.

PROMPTS
   User's Name:
     Enter the name of the user to receive your message.  You may
     also enter the line or terminal that the user is connected
     to.

FILES
     /etc/utmp  To find user
     /bin/sh    To execute !

SEE ALSO
     mail(1), mesg(1), pr(1), sh(1), who(1).

DIAGNOSTICS
     user not logged in       Means the person you are trying to
                              write to is not logged in.
