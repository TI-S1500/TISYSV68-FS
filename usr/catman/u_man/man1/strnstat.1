NAME
     strnstat - Displays StreamsNet statistics

SYNOPSIS
     strnstat -cIi [mem] [namelist]

DESCRIPTION
   Purpose
     The strnstat utility displays the StreamsNet statistics for
     one or all network interfaces.  This information is useful
     for a system analyst to monitor normal StreamsNet operations
     or to troubleshoot the StreamsNet interfaces.

   Arguments
     mem     Name of file that contains the system image. The
	     default value is /dev/kmem.  A hyphen (-) can be
	     specified in this field to indicate default system
	     image file.

     namelist
	     Name of file to be used for symbol values. The
	     default value is /unix.

   Options
     -c      Resets the statistics back to 0 after displaying the
	     current statistics. This option should only be used
	     when you are monitoring the current running system.
	     The counters and the elapsed time for the specified
	     interfaces will both be reset after the display.

     -I      Displays the statistics of all of the StreamsNet
	     interfaces. A summary of the usage of the StreamsNet
	     heap pool is also displayed.

     -i ifname
	     Displays the statistics of the specified StreamsNet
	     interface. The ifname is the interface name assigned
	     by the system administrator when the StreamsNet
	     interface is initialized.

EXAMPLE
     The following command line reports the statistics of all of
     the StreamsNet interfaces on the current running system:

	  strnstat -I

     The following is an example of the information returned by
     the preceding command upon normal completion:

	  -------------------------- strnstat -----------------------

	  Interface name: en040

	  Elapsed time: 1: 0: 9:31

	  No. of links: 2

	  ********************* STRNET STATISTICS *******************

	  Current no. of STRNET elements allocated: 42

	  Max. no. of STRNET elements allocated: 54

	  No. of failed allocation: 0

	  Current used size of the STRNET pool: 3144

	  Max. used size of the STRNET pool: 4344

	  Total size of the STRNET pool: 20480

NOTES
      1.    Interface name - The name assigned to the StreamsNet
	    interface at the initialization time.

      2.    Elapsed time - The elapsed time since the last time
	    the statistics were initialized or cleared. The
	    format is day:hour:minute:second.

      3.    No. of links - Number of links established through
	    this interface to the CCB streams driver.

      4.    Outbound/lnbound messages - Number of Streams
	    messages sent or received through this interface
	    during the elapsed time.

      5.    Outbound/Inbound no. of bytes - Number of bytes sent
	    or received through this interface during the elapsed
	    time.

      6.    STRNET STATISTICS - A summary of the StreamsNet
	    (STRNET) heap pool usage. The STRNET heap pool is an
	    array of bytes reserved by the StreamsNet for dynamic
	    allocation/deallocation of the STRNET elements.  The
	    STRNET elements are variable sized buffers used by
	    the StreamsNet to communicate with the CCB Streams
	    driver. The size of the STRNET heap pool is a system
	    configuration (cband) parameter.

      7.    Current no. of STRNET elements allocated - Total
	    Number of STRNET elements currently allocated on the
	    system for transmitting or receiving messages.

      8.    Max. no. of STRNET elements allocated - The maximum
	    number of STRNET elements that has ever been
	    allocated on the system for transmitting or receiving
	    messages.

      9.    No. of failed allocation - Number of times that a
	    STRNET element cannot be allocated right away.

     10.    Current used size of the STRNET pool - Total number
	    of bytes currently allocated for the STRNET elements
	    out of the STRNET pool.

     11.    Max. used size of the STRNET pool - The maximum
	    number of bytes in the STRNET pool that has ever been
	    allocated for the STRNET elements.

     12.    Total size of the STRNET pool - Total number of bytes
	    reserved for the STRNET heap pool on the system. This
	    number can be tuned by changing the cband parameter
	    "Streams net heapsize".

PROMPTS
   Interface Name:
     Enter the name of the specific interface whose statistics is
     desired. The default is to get the statistics from all of
     the StreamsNet interfaces.

   Clear After Display:
     The default value is no. If you enter yes, the statistics of
     the specified interface will be reset internally after the
     display.
