LOGIN(1)                                                 LOGIN(1)

NAME
     login - Signs on

SYNOPSIS
     login name [env-var ...]

DESCRIPTION
   Purpose
     The login command is used to identify you to the system at
     the beginning of each terminal session.

   Discussion
     The login command can be invoked as a command or by the
     system when a connection is first established.  It is
     invoked by the system when a previous user has terminated
     the initial shell by typing a CTRL-D to indicate an end-of-
     file.

     If login is invoked as a command it must replace the initial
     command interpreter.  This is accomplished by typing:

          exec login

     from the initial shell.

     The login command asks for your user name (if not supplied
     as an argument) and, if appropriate, your password.  Echoing
     is turned off (where possible) during the typing of your
     password, so it does not appear on the written record of the
     session.

     At some installations, an option may be invoked that
     requires you to enter a second dialup password.  This occurs
     only for dial-up connections, and is prompted by the message
     dialup password:.  Both passwords are required for a
     successful login.

     If you do not complete the login successfully within a
     certain period of time (e.g., one minute), you are likely to
     be silently disconnected.

     After a successful login, accounting files are updated, the
     procedure /etc/profile is performed, the message-of-the-day,
     if any, is printed, the user-ID, the group-ID, the working
     directory, and the command interpreter, usually sh(1) or
     bsh(1T), are initialized, and the file .profile in the
     working directory is executed, if it exists.  These
     specifications are found in the /etc/passwd file entry for
     the user.  The name of the command interpreter is -,
     followed by the last component of the interpreter's path
     name (i.e., -sh).  If this field in the password file is
     empty, then the default command interpreter, /bin/sh is
     used.

   Environment
     The basic environment (see environ(5)) is initialized to:

          HOME=your-login-directory
          PATH=:/bin:/usr/bin
          SHELL=last-field-of-passwd-entry
          MAIL=/usr/mail/your-login-name
          TZ=timezone-specification

     The environment may be expanded or modified by supplying
     additional arguments to login, either at execution time or
     when login requests your login name.  The arguments may take
     either the form xxx or xxx=yyy. Arguments without an equal
     sign are placed in the environment as
          Ln=xxx
     where n is a number starting at 0 and is incremented each
     time a new variable name is required.  Variables containing
     an = are placed into the environment without modification.
     If they already appear in the environment, then they replace
     the older value.  There are two exceptions.  The variables
     PATH and SHELL cannot be changed.  This prevents people,
     logging into restricted shell environments, from spawning
     secondary shells that are not restricted.  Both login and
     getty(1) understand simple single-character quoting
     conventions.  Typing a backslash in front of a character
     quotes it and allows the inclusion of such things as spaces
     and tabs.

EXAMPLE
     In the following example the user types the command login
     and the following prompt is displayed:

          login:

     The user responds to this prompt with a login name.

FILES
     /etc/utmp            accounting
     /etc/wtmp            accounting
     /usr/mail/your-name  mailbox for user your-name
     /etc/motd            message-of-the-day
     /etc/passwd          password file
     /etc/profile         system profile
     .profile             user's login profile

DIAGNOSTICS
     Login incorrect    The user name or password cannot be
                        matched.

     No shell           Consult a system programming counselor.

     cannot open password file
                        Consult a system programming counselor.

     no directory       Consult a system programming counselor.

     Not login shell.   You must exec ``login'' from the lowest
                        level ``sh''.  You attempted to execute
                        login as a command without using the
                        shell's exec internal command or from
                        other than the initial shell.
