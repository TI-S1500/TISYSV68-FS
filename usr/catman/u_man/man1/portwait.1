PORTWAIT(1T)                                         PORTWAIT(1T)

NAME
     portwait - Waits for a tty device to open or close

SYNOPSIS
     portwait ttyXX
     portwait -c ttyXX

DESCRIPTION
   Discussion
     The portwait command is provided for use on TI 1500 systems
     that do not have built-in UPS support hardware and must
     reply on the status of a serial port to indicate the
     condition of power to the system. On these systems, portwait
     will monitor a tty port for an open or a close.

     If you specify ttyXX, portwait will attempt to open the
     specified tty device. When proper signals are applied to the
     tty device, the port will become openable. portwait will
     then exit.

     If you specify -c ttyXX, portwait will open the specified tty
     device and wait for a loss of signals to the port (causing
     SIGHUP to be sent to portwait). When signals are lost,
     portwait will exit.

     This command is designed for use within shell scripts to
     stop their execution until the state of a tty port changes.
