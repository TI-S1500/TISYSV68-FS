DU(1)                                                       DU(1)

NAME
     du - Summarizes disk usage

SYNOPSIS
     du -ars names

DESCRIPTION
   Purpose
     The du command reports the number of 1K-byte blocks
     contained in all files and (recursively) directories within
     each directory and file specified by the names argument.

     The block count includes the indirect blocks of the file.
     If the names argument is missing, . (all) is assumed.  A
     file with two or more links is only counted once.

   Options
     -a   Causes an entry to be generated for each file.  Absence
          of either -a or -s causes an entry to be generated for
          each directory only.

     -r   Generates messages about directories that cannot be
          read.  The du command is normally silent in such
          instances.

     -s   Causes only the grand total for each of the specified
          names to be reported.

EXAMPLE
     The following example displays the block count within all
     files and directories within the directory dir1.  The
     example displays messages for directories that cannot be
     read.

          du -r dir1

PROMPTS
   Input File Name(s):
     Enter the path name of the file to process.

   Display Blocks/File:
     The initial value is no.  Enter yes to display information
     for each file.

   Generate Status Messages:
     The initial value is no.  Enter yes to display messages
     about directories that cannot be read.

   Display Total Blocks:
     The initial value is no.  Enter yes to display only the
     grand total for each file.

NOTES
     If the -a option is not used, nondirectories given as
     arguments are not listed.

     If there are too many distinct linked files, du counts the
     excess files more than once.

     Files with spaces not accounted for get an incorrect block
     count.
