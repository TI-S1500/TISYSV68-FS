TEST(1)                                                   TEST(1)

NAME
     test - Evaluates a test condition

SYNOPSIS
     test expr

DESCRIPTION
   Purpose
     The test command is a Bourne shell, sh(1), built-in command.
     The command evaluates the expression expr and returns a zero
     (true) exit status if its value is true or a nonzero (false)
     exit status if its value is false.  This command also
     returns a nonzero exit status if there are no arguments.

     Note that all the operators and flags are separate arguments
     to test and that parentheses are meaningful to the shell and
     therefore must be escaped.

   Primitives
     The following primitives are used to construct expr:

     -r file     True if file exists and is readable

     -w file     True if file exists and is writable

     -x file     True if file exists and is executable

     -f file     True if file exists and is a regular file

     -d file     True if file exists and is a directory

     -c file     True if file exists and is a character special
                 file

     -b file     True if file exists and is a block special file

     -p file     True if file exists and is a named pipe (fifo)

     -u file     True if file exists and its set-user-ID bit is
                 set

     -g file     True if file exists and its set-group-ID bit is
                 set

     -k file     True if file exists and its sticky bit is set

     -s file     True if file exists and has a size greater than
                 zero

     -t [ fildes ]
                 True if the open file whose file descriptor
                 number is fildes (1 by default) is associated
                 with a terminal device

     -z s1       True if the length of string s1 is zero

     -n s1       True if the length of the string s1 is nonzero

     s1 = s2     True if strings s1 and s2 are identical

     s1 != s2    True if strings s1 and s2 are not identical

     s1          True if s1 is not the null string

     n1 -eq n2   True if the integers n1 and n2 are algebraically
                 equal (Any of the comparisons -ne, -gt, -ge,
                 -lt, and -le may be used in place of -eq.)

   Operators
     Primitives can be combined with the following operators:

     !           unary negation operator

     -a          binary and operator

     -o          binary or operator (-a has higher precedence
                 than -o.)

     ( expr )    parentheses for grouping

EXAMPLE
     The example that follows illustrates the use of test in
     shell scripts.  If file1 is executable and if its set-user-
     ID bit is set, a message is printed.

          if (test -x file1 -a -u file1) then
              echo "file1 is executable"
          fi
