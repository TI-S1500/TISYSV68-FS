LTXDUMP(1T)                                           LTXDUMP(1T)

NAME
     ltxdump - Invokes the 68020 assembler linker text dump
     utility

SYNOPSIS
     ltxdump -s file
     ltxdump -s =file
     ltxdump -s [dmp],[sym]=file

DESCRIPTION
   Purpose
     The ltxdump command processes an intermediate linker text
     (ltx) file created by the 68020 assembler source processor
     as(1T) and produces a printable dump file.  The ltxdump
     command also produces an optional symbol data file for input
     to the symbol report generator qsym(1T).

   Option
     -s   Includes symbol table in the symbol data file read by
          qsym.

   Arguments
     dmp  User-defined linker text dump output file name.  If no
          suffix is specified, the default file name suffix .dmp
          is appended to this value.

     sym  User-defined symbol data output file name.  If no
          suffix is specified, the default file name suffix .sym
          is appended to this value.

   Discussion
     The ltxdump command appends the default file name suffix
     .ltx to the input file name if no suffix is specified.

     The default output file name suffixes are .dmp (linker text
     dump) and .sym (symbol data).

     Specify output file requirements in one of the following
     three ways:

     + If you omit the = from the command line, each output file
       name is derived by adding the appropriate default suffix
       (.dmp, .sym) to the input file name.

     + If you include the = and do not specify a user-defined
       output file name, only the linker text dump file is
       produced (its name is derived as described above).
       Options related to generation of the symbol data file are
       ignored if specified.

     + If you include the = and one or more user-defined output
       file names, only those files corresponding to the user-
       defined names are produced.  The appropriate default
       suffix (.dmp, .sym) is appended to each user-defined name
       for which no suffix is specified.

     Object data in the ltx file is interpreted by ltxdump
     according to ltx file formatting conventions and organized
     into a list of formatted ASCII object records, one per line.
     See the TI System V 68020 Assembler manual for a detailed
     description of the ltxdump report format.

     Many of the error messages produced by the linker text
     conversion utility ltxcoff(1T) contain a record number that
     may be used as an index into the ltxdump report file
     listing.  This record number indicates the sequential
     position within the linker text file of the object record
     that caused the error.  Object records are listed by ltxdump
     in the same order that they appear in the linker text file.
     The first object record listed is record 0, the next is
     record 1, and so on.  By counting the object records listed
     in the ltxdump report in this way, you can locate a record
     number given in an ltxcoff error message and examine the
     object record that caused the error.

EXAMPLES
     The following example processes the input file lt30.ltx and
     produces the output file lt30.dmp.

          ltxdump lt30

     The following example processes the input file lt30.ltx and
     produces the output files lt30.dmp and lt30.sym.

          ltxdump -s lt30

     The following example processes the input file lt30.ltx and
     produces the output file ltx.lst.

          ltxdump ltx.lst=lt30

     The following example processes the input file lt30.ltx and
     produces the output file lt30.sym (suppressing lt30.dmp).

          ltxdump -s ,lt30=lt30

PROMPTS
   Input File Name:
     Enter the name of the file to process.

   Append Symbol Table to Error Listing:
     The initial value is no.  Enter yes to include the symbol
     table in the symbol data file.

     Select only one or none of the following prompts:

   Define Output File Names:
     The initial value is no.  Enter yes to specify user-defined
     output text dump and symbol data file names.

   Produce Only the Dump File:
     The initial value is no.  Enter yes to produce the dump file
     only.

     If you enter yes at the Define Output File Names: prompt,
     the following two prompts are displayed.

   Linker Text Dump File Name:
     Enter a user-defined name for the linker text dump file.

   Symbol Table File Name:
     Enter a user-defined name for the symbol table file.

DIAGNOSTICS
     Exit status values are as follows:

     + 0 - Completed with no errors and no warnings

     + 1 - Completed with no errors; warnings only

     + 2 - Completed with error(s)

     + 3 - Aborted; did not run to completion
