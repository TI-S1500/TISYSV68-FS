NAME
     rmdel - Removes a delta from an SCCS file

SYNOPSIS
     rmdel -r files

DESCRIPTION
   Purpose
     The rmdel command removes the delta specified by the SID
     from each named SCCS file.

   Option
     -rSID
          Specifies the SID of the delta to be removed.

   Discussion
     The delta to be removed must be the newest (most recent)
     delta in its branch in the delta chain of each named SCCS
     file.  In addition, the specified SID must not be that of a
     version being edited for the purpose of making a delta
     (i.e., if a p-file (see get(1)) exists for the named SCCS
     file, the specified SID must not appear in any entry of the
     p-file).

     If a directory is named, rmdel behaves as though each file
     in the directory were specified as a named file, except that
     non-SCCS files (last component of the path name does not
     begin with s.)  and unreadable files are silently ignored.
     If a name of - is given, the standard input is read; each
     line of the standard input is taken to be the name of an
     SCCS file to be processed; non-SCCS files and unreadable
     files are silently ignored.

     The exact permissions necessary to remove a delta are
     documented in the ``Source Code Control System'' in the TI
     System V Support Tools Guide.  Simply stated they are either
     (1) if you make a delta you can remove it; or (2) if you own
     the file and directory you can remove a delta.

EXAMPLE
     The following example removes the latest delta from branch
     1.3 from the SCCS file named file1.

          rmdel -r1.3.2.3
