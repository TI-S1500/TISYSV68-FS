CBAND(1T)                                               CBAND(1T)

NAME
     cband - Initializes, displays, or modifies a disk
     configuration partition

SYNOPSIS
     cband -acdilmprsu args

DESCRIPTION
   Purpose
     The cband command initializes, displays, or modifies the
     contents of a configuration partition.

   Configuration Partition
     A disk device path name (for example, /dev/dsk/sys:cfg1)
     specifies the configuration partition.  The partition must
     exist and be large enough to hold all configuration modules.
     The configuration partition is designed to be used in a
     heterogeneous or homogeneous multiprocessor environment.

     The partition contains information that the STBM primitive
     uses to boot processors and slave devices.  A slave device
     is a smart peripheral, such as the storage-module-drive
     (SMD)/SCSI mass storage controller (MSC).  The partition
     consists of a configuration module for each processor or
     slave device to be booted.

     The configuration module describes the load source and
     provides the load partition name.  It also gives operating
     system-specific configuration parameters for all processors
     in the system.  In order to save disk space and simplify
     modifications, TI System V uses the same configuration
     module for each secondary processor in a multiprocessor
     configuration.

     A configuration partition contains up to 16 configuration
     modules.  For purposes of display or modification, a
     configuration module is specified by its entry number.
     Entry numbers are 0 through 9 and A through F.  Any
     configuration module that is used for more than one board
     type uses more than one entry number. Because the TI System
     V configuration module is used for more than one board type,
     it uses more than one entry number. For purposes of display
     or modification, either entry number can be used.  Each
     module can be associated with all slots, specific slots, or
     no slots.  A configuration module may be associated with a
     slot regardless whether there is a processor in that slot.
     The module will be used only in the event that a processor
     is in that slot when the system is booted.

     No two configuration modules for the same processor can be
     associated with the same slot.

     It is the responsibility of the user to ensure that two
     users are not using cband at the same time on the same
     configuration partition.

     See the appendix entitled Configurable System Parameters in
     the TI System V Administrator's Guide for a description,
     including minimum and default values, of all system
     parameters that you can change with cband.

   Options
     One and only one option can be specified.

     -a config_part src_entry parameter_name
          Adds the configurable parameter name and value
          specified by parameter_name to the configuration module
          specified by src_entry in the configuration partition
          specified by config_part.  This option should be used
          only by the installation scripts for add-on packages.

     -c src_config src_entry dest_config dest_entry
          Copies a configuration module from one configuration
          partition to another.

          The device path name of the configuration partition
          src_config contains the configuration module to be
          copied.  The argument src_entry specifies which module
          is to be copied.  The name dest_config is the device
          path name of the configuration partition to which the
          configuration module is copied.  The term dest_entry
          identifies the entry in which the module will be placed
          in the destination configuration partition.

          The source and destination configuration partitions can
          be the same.  The destination partition must contain
          sufficient space to hold the new configuration module.
          If the destination entry previously contained a
          configuration module, this module is lost.

          The src_config path name may be that of a labeled tape
          (that is, a distribution tape).  The first
          configuration partition on the tape will be used as the
          configuration partition.

     -d config_part [entry]
          Provides a detailed display of the contents of the
          configuration partition.

          The value config_part is the device path name of the
          configuration partition.  If entry is specified, only
          the configuration module in that entry is displayed.
          If entry is not specified, all configuration modules
          are displayed.  Valid entry identifications are the
          numerals 0 through 9 and letters A through F.

     -i config_part
          Initializes the specified configuration partition to
          contain a single TI System V configuration module
          associated with all possible slots.  The value
          config_part is the device path name of the
          configuration partition.

          After executing cband with the -i option, the utility
          can be executed again with the -m (modify) option.
          This second execution is necessary to modify the
          operating system configuration parameter values to
          those appropriate for the actual configuration.

     -l config_part entry slot[,slot...]
          Links a configuration module to another slot.

          The option value config_part is the device path name of
          the configuration partition.  The value entry is the
          identification of a configuration module.  The value
          slot is the identification, or list of slot
          identifications separated by blanks, for the new slot
          to be associated with the configuration module.

     -m config_part [entry]
          Allows interactive verification and modification of
          each changeable parameter with the configuration
          partition.

          Extreme caution should be used in the modification of
          configuration parameters because parameters are not
          verified thoroughly.  Incorrect values are detected at
          boot time and may be modified interactively from the
          boot terminal.

          The option value config_part is the device path name of
          the configuration partition.  If entry is specified,
          only the configuration module in that entry is
          modified.  If entry is not specified, all configuration
          modules are modified.  Valid entry identifications are
          the numerals 0 through 9 and letters A through F.

          Each parameter is displayed with its current value.  If
          the user presses the Return key and enters no other
          characters, the value remains unchanged.  If the user
          enters any characters other than a carriage return or
          *, the old parameter value is replaced by the new
          value.  If an asterisk (*) is entered for any value,
          the default value is used.

     -p config_part src_entry parameter_name
          Specifies that the value of the configurable parameter
          specified by parameter_name is to be examined and/or
          modified.  The utility determines the current value for
          the specified parameter in the configuration module
          specified by src_entry and the configuration partition
          specified by config_part. The configuration module name
          specified by src_entry must be enclosed in double
          quotes and be exactly 32 characters long.  The
          parameter name specified by parameter_name must also be
          enclosed in double quotes, must end with a colon
          character, and must match exactly with the name of an
          existing parameter in the configuration module.  This
          option allows shell scripts to be developed that prompt
          the user to modify only certain parameters instead of
          using the more general, but time-consuming, -m option,
          which prompts the user for every parameter.

     -r config_part entry
          Removes a configuration module from the configuration
          entry.

          The option value config_part is the device path name of
          the configuration partition.  Valid entry
          identifications are the numerals 0 through 9 and
          letters A through F.

     -s config_part
          Provides a summary of the configuration partition.
          This summary identifies the configuration module
          associated with each slot.  See the EXAMPLE part of
          this manual entry for a sample of the output that the
          -s option produces.

          The option value config_part is the device path name of
          the configuration partition.  The config_part path name
          may be that of a labeled tape (that is, a distribution
          tape).  The first configuration partition on the tape
          will be used as the configuration partition.

     -u config_part entry slot[,slot...]
          Unlinks a configuration module from the specified
          slot(s).  The config_part argument is the device path
          name entry.  The entry argument is the entry
          identification of the configuration module.  The slot
          argument is a slot (or list of slots) from which the
          module is to be unlinked.

          Valid slot identifications are the numerals 0 through 9
          and the letters A through F.  It is not necessary to
          unlink configuration modules from slots that do not
          contain processor boards.  The module is only used in
          the event that a board is actually present in the slot.

EXAMPLE
     The following is a sample output for the command cband -s
     /dev/dsk/sys:cfg2:

          Entry 0
          Configuration module for TI System V
          Hardware: MC68020/MC680X0 CPU in any slot
