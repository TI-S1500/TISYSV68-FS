TIC(1M)                                                   TIC(1M)

NAME
     tic - Compiles terminfo source

SYNOPSIS
     tic -cv file

DESCRIPTION
   Purpose
     The tic command translates terminfo files from the source
     format into the compiled format.  The results are placed in
     the directory /usr/lib/terminfo.

     Only the super-user can use this command.

   Option
     -c   Checks file for errors, only.

     -v[n]
          Causes tic to output trace information showing the
          progress of the command.  The optional n value is a
          number from 1 through 4.  For n values, the trace
          information is reported as follows:

          1  Shows files linked and created

          2  Shows files linked and created as well as number
             variables

          3  Shows files linked and created, number variables,
             and Boolean variables

          4  Shows files linked and created, number variables,
             Boolean variables, and string variables

     See Capabilities in terminfo(4).

   Argument
     file Name of file that contains one or more terminfo
          descriptions in source format of the capabilities of
          particular terminals.

   Discussion
     When tic finds a use= entry-name field in a terminal entry,
     the utility reads in the binary from /usr/lib/terminfo to
     complete the entry.  (tic uses entries created from file
     first, and if the environment variable TERMINFO is set, tic
     searches that directory instead of /usr/lib/terminfo.)

     Total compiled entries cannot exceed 4096 bytes. The name
     field cannot exceed 128 bytes.

     Terminal names exceeding 14 characters will be truncated to
     14 characters and a warning message will be printed.

     When the -c option is used, duplicate terminal names will
     not be diagnosed; however, when -c is not used, they will
     be.

PROMPTS
   File Name(s):
     Enter the name of the files to be processed.

   Level of Trace (1-4):
     Select the level of trace information showing the progress
     of the command.

DIAGNOSTICS
     Most diagnostic messages produced by tic during the
     compilation of the source file are preceded with the
     approximate line number and the name of the terminal
     currently being worked on.

     mkdir ... returned bad status
          The named directory could not be created.

     File does not start with terminal names in column one
          The first thing seen in the file, after comments, must
          be the list of terminal names.

     Token after a seek(2) not NAMES
          Somehow the file being compiled changed during the
          compilation.

     Not enough memory for use_list element
          or

     Out of memory
          Not enough free memory was available (malloc(3)
          failed).

     Can't open...
          The named file could not be created.

     Error in writing...
          The named file could not be written to.

     Can't link ... to ...
          A link failed.

     Error in re-reading compiled file...
          The compiled file could not be read back in.

     Premature EOF
          The current entry ended prematurely.

     Backspaced off beginning of line
          This error indicates something wrong happened within
          tic.

     Unknown Capability - "..."
          The named invalid capability was found within the file.

     "..." non-existent or permission denied
          The given directory could not be written into.

     "..." is not a directory.
          Self-explanatory

     "...": Permission denied
          Access denied.

     "...": Not a directory
          tic wanted to use the given name as a directory, but it
          already exists as a file.

     SYSTEM ERROR!! Fork failed!!!
          A fork(2) failed.

     Error in following up use-links.
          Either there is a loop in the links or they reference
          non-existent terminals.  A terminfo entry with a
          use=name capability either referred to a non-existent
          terminal called name or name somehow referred back to
          the given entry.
