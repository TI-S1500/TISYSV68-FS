CTAGS(1)                                                 CTAGS(1)

NAME
     ctags - Creates a tags file

SYNOPSIS
     ctags [-auvwx] name

DESCRIPTION
   Purpose
     The ctags command makes a tags file for vi(1) from the
     specified C sources.

   Discussion
     A tags file provides the locations of specified objects (in
     this case, functions) in a group of files.  Each line of the
     tags file contains the function name, the file in which it
     is defined, and a scanning pattern used to find the function
     definition.  These are located in the separate fields of the
     line, separated by blanks or tabs.  Using the tags file, vi
     can quickly find these function definitions.

   Options
     -x   Produces a list of function names, the line number and
          file name in which each is defined, and the text of
          that line, and writes the list to the standard output.
          No tags file is created.  The list is an index that can
          be printed and used as an offline readable function
          index.

     -w   Suppresses warning diagnostics.

     -u   Causes the specified files to be updated in tags; that
          is, all references to them are deleted, and the new
          values are appended to the file. Note that it is
          usually faster to rebuild the tags file than to use
          this option.

     File names that have extensions of .c or .h are assumed to
     be C source files and are searched for C routine and macro
     definitions.

     The tag main is treated specially in C programs.  The tag
     formed is created by prepending M to the name of the file,
     with a trailing .c removed, if any, and leading path name
     components removed.  This makes use of ctags practical in
     directories with more than one program.
