MAN(1)                                                     MAN(1)

NAME
     man - Prints entries in the TI System V User's Reference
     manual

SYNOPSIS
     man -dw titles

DESCRIPTION
   Purpose
     The man command locates and prints the manual entry named
     title from the TI System V User's Reference manual.  (The
     term man page is an abbreviation of manual entry.)

     The title(s) is entered in lowercase.  As an example, man
     man reproduces on the terminal the manual entry for man(1).

   Options
     -d   Search the current directory rather than /usr/catman.
          This option requires the full file name (e.g., cu.1c ,
          rather than just cu).

     -w   Print on the standard output only the path names of the
          entries, relative to /usr/catman or to the current
          directory for the -d option.

EXAMPLE
     The following example prints the chmod(1) description from
     the TI System V User's Reference manual.

          man chmod

PROMPTS
   Titles:
     Enter the desired manual entry or entries.  Separate
     multiple entries with a space.

   Output File Name:
     Enter the name of the file to receive the manual entry.  The
     default is the standard output.

   Accept Default Options:
     The initial value is yes. Enter no to receive the following
     prompts.

   Search Current Directory:
     The default is no.

   Print Path Names Only:
     The default is no.

FILES
     /usr/catman/u_man/man1/*

NOTES
     All entries are intended to be reproducible on a terminal.
     The usr/catman/a_man/man1 directory is searched before
     /usr/catman/u_man/man1. If a file name appears in both
     directories, the a_man entry appears before the u_man entry.
