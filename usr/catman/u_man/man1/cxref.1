CXREF(1)                                                 CXREF(1)

NAME
     cxref - Generates C program cross-reference

SYNOPSIS
     cxref -cDIUostw files

DESCRIPTION
   Purpose
     The cxref program analyzes a collection of C files and
     attempts to build a cross-reference table.

     The command utilizes a special version of cpp to include
     #define information in its symbol table.  It produces a
     listing on standard output of all symbols (auto, static, and
     global) in each file separately, or with the -c option, in
     combination.  Each symbol contains an asterisk (*) before
     the declaring reference.

   Options
     -c   Prints a combined cross-reference of all input files.

     -Dsym
          Defines a symbol to the preprocessor. This mechanism is
          useful with the conditional statements in the
          preprocessor by allowing symbols to be defined external
          to the source file.

     -Idir
          Changes the algorithm for searching for #include files
          whose names do not begin with / to look in the
          specified directory before looking in the directories
          on the standard list.  Thus, #include files whose names
          are enclosed in double quotes are searched for first in
          the directory of the file argument, then in directories
          named in -I options, and last in directories on a
          standard list.  For #include files whose names are
          enclosed in <>, the directory of the file argument is
          not searched.

     -Usym
          Undefines the symbol that you defined with the -D
          option.

     -o file
          Directs output to the named file.

     -s   Operates silently. Input file names are not printed.

     -t   Specifies 80-column width in the formatted output.

     -w[num]
          Specifies specifies the maximum number of columns in
          the formatted output.  This option defaults to 80 if a
          value is not specified or is less than 51.

PROMPTS
   Input File Name(s):
     Enter the names of the files to process.

   Output File Name:
     Response to this prompt is optional.  Enter a file name to
     receive the output of the command.

   Combined Cross-Reference:
     The initial value is no.  Enter yes to print a combined
     cross-reference of all input files.

   Define Symbol:
     Response to this prompt is optional.  Enter a character as a
     symbol that is defined to the preprocessor.

   Undefine Symbol:
     Response to this prompt is optional.  Enter a character that
     you previously defined to the processor and that you now
     undefine.

   Maximum Number of Columns (51-80):
     Integer.  The initial value is 80.  Enter a number that
     specifies a maximum of columns in the formatted output.

SEE ALSO
     cc(1).

DIAGNOSTICS
     Error messages usually mean that you cannot compile the C
     files.
