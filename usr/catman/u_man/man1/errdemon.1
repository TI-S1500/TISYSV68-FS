ERRDEMON(1M)                                         ERRDEMON(1M)

NAME
     errdemon - Provides an error-logging daemon

SYNOPSIS
     errdemon -c

DESCRIPTION
   Purpose
     The error-logging daemon errdemon collects error records
     from the operating system by reading the special file
     /dev/error.

     Only the super-user can start the daemon, and only one error
     daemon can be active at any time.

   Options
     -c  Causes errdemon to log all messages to the system
         console as well as to the error file.

   Discussion
     The daemon places the error records in the error file
     /usr/adm/errfile.  The error file is created if it does not
     exist.  If the error file exists, error records are appended
     to it so that no previous error data is lost.

     Error records are appended to /usr/adm/errfile until the
     file reaches a size greater than 1,000 multiplied by the
     largest record in /usr/adm/errfile.  The error file is then
     renamed by appending .old to it (/usr/adm/errfile.old).  The
     error file is recreated as /usr/adm/errfile.

     No analysis of the error records is done by errdemon.
     Analysis of error records is done by errpt(1M).

     The error-logging daemon is terminated by sending it a
     software kill signal, as explained in signal(2).

FILES
     /dev/error               Source of error records
     /usr/adm/errfile         Repository for error records
     /usr/adm/errfile.old     Repository for error records
