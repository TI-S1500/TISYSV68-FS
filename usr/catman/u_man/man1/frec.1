FREC(1M)                                                 FREC(1M)

NAME
     frec - Recovers files from a backup tape

SYNOPSIS
     frec -fpm raw-tape [inumbers:names]

DESCRIPTION
   Purpose
     The frec command uses inumbers to recover files from the
     specified raw-tape backup tape written by volcopy(1M) or
     finc(1M).  The data for each recovery request is written
     into the file given by name.

   Options
     -f reqfile
             Specifies a file containing recovery
             requests.    The file format is inumber:newname,
             with one entry per line.

     -p path Allows specification of a default prefixing path
             different from the current working directory.  This
             path name is prefixed to any names that are not
             fully qualified that do not begin with / or ./.  If
             any directories are missing in recovery path names,
             they are created.

     -m      Specifies that frec is being used to recover a file
             from a multiple file system tape.

EXAMPLES
     The following command recovers file inumber 1216, which is
     backed-up into a file named junk in the current working
     directory:

          frec /dev/rqt/0h 1216:junk

     The following command recovers files with inumbers 14156,
     1232, and 3141 into files /usr/src/cmd/a, /usr/src/cmd/b,
     and /usr/src/cmd/a.c:

          frec -p /usr/src/cmd /dev/rqt/0h 14156:a 1232:b
          3141:a.c

     The following command recovers the file junk (inumber 1216)
     from the second file system on a multiple file system
     volcopy tape, and creates a file named junk in the current
     working directory:

          dd  if=/dev/rvt/0hn of=/dev/null bs=16k

          frec -m /dev/rvt/0hn 1216:junk

PROMPTS
   I-Number:Name List:
     Response to this prompt is optional.  Enter the file inumber
     and file names to be recovered from the tape.

   Recovery Request File:
     Enter the name of the file contain the list of inumbers and
     file names to be recovered.

   Backup Tape Name:
     Enter the name of the device named containing the backup
     tape.

   Prefixing Path:
     Enter the name of the prefixing directory if different from
     the current working directory.

SEE ALSO
     cpio(1), ff(1M), finc(1M), labelit(1M), volcopy(1M).

NOTES
     While creating the intermediate directories contained in a
     path name, frec can recover inode fields only for those
     directories contained on the tape and requested for
     recovery.

     For files that frec recovers, the access date is the date of
     the recovery.
