GETOPTCVT(1)                                         GETOPTCVT(1)

NAME
     getoptcvt - Parses command options

SYNOPSIS
     /usr/lib/getoptcvt [-b] file

DESCRIPTION
     /usr/lib/getoptcvt reads the shell script in file, converts
     it to use getopts(1) instead of getopt(1), and writes the
     results on the standard output.

     -b   the results of running /usr/lib/getoptcvt will be
          portable to earlier releases of TI System V.
          /usr/lib/getoptcvt modifies the shell script in file so
          that when the resulting shell script is executed, it
          determines at run time whether to invoke getopts(1) or
          getopt(1).

SEE ALSO
     getopt(3C), getopts(1), sh(1).
