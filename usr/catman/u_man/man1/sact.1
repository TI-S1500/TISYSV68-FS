SACT(1)                                                   SACT(1)

NAME
     sact - Prints current SCCS file editing activity

SYNOPSIS
     sact files

DESCRIPTION
   Purpose
     The sact command informs the user of any impending deltas to
     a named SCCS file.  This situation occurs when get(1) with
     the -e option has been previously executed without a
     subsequent execution of delta(1).

   Discussion
     If a directory is named on the command line, sact behaves as
     though each file in the directory were specified as a named
     file, except that non-SCCS files and unreadable files are
     silently ignored.  If a name of - is given, the standard
     input is read with each line being taken as the name of an
     SCCS file to be processed.

     The output for each named file consists of five fields
     separated by spaces.

          Field 1   Specifies the SID of a delta that currently
                    exists in the SCCS file to which changes will
                    be made to make the new delta.

          Field 2   Specifies the SID for the new delta to be
                    created.

          Field 3   Contains the login name of the user who will
                    make the delta (i.e. executed a get for
                    editing).

          Field 4   Contains the date that get -e was executed.

          Field 5   Contains the time that get -e was executed.

EXAMPLE
     Assume that you executed a get(1) with intent to edit (get
     -e) command but have not executed a delta(1) command on the
     SCCS file named s.file1.  Enter the following command to
     find the current SCCS file editing activity on s.file1.

          sact s.file1

     The output of the command might be similar to the following:

          1.2 1.3 rwr 85/10/02 10:41:59

     This indicates that a new version of s.file1 numbered 1.3 is
     in the process of being made from version 1.2 by user rwr.
     The get -e command was executed at 10:41:59 on October 2,
     1985.
