NAME
     labelit - Provides labels for disk or tape file system

SYNOPSIS

DESCRIPTION
   Purpose
     The labelit command can be used to provide initial labels
     for unmounted disk or tape file systems.  With the optional
     arguments omitted, labelit prints current label values.

   Option
     -n   Provides for initial labeling of new tapes only.  This
          option destroys previous contents.

   Arguments
     fsname   The mounted name (such as root, u1, or usr) of the
              file system to be labeled.  The name length is
              limited to four characters.

              /dev/rqt/0h or /dev/rmt/0h) to label.

     volname  The physical volume name (such as pk3 or t0122) to
              label.  The label name is limited to six or fewer
              characters.  If volname is specified as -, the
              existing volume name is used.

     The fsname and volume arguments are recorded in the the
     super block.  The name declarations are char s_fname[6],
     s_fpack[6];.
