DEROFF(1)                                               DEROFF(1)

NAME
     deroff - Removes nroff, troff, tbl, and eqn constructs

SYNOPSIS
     deroff -mw [files]

DESCRIPTION
   Purpose
     The deroff utility reads each file in sequence and removes
     all troff requests, macro calls, backslash constructs, and
     tbl descriptions, and writes the remainder of the file on
     standard output.  (The nroff, troff, tbl, and eqn utilities
     and preprocessors are not supplied with TI System V.)

     The utility operates on chains of included files specified
     by the .so and .nx troff commands.  If the roff utility has
     already included a file, deroff ignores a subsequent .so
     construct that names the included file and terminates
     execution if deroff encounters a .nx construct that names
     the included file.

     The utility reads standard input if you do not specify
     files.

   Options
     -mx  Specifies the type of input file, where x can be l, m,
          or s, meaning ml, mm, or ms macro files, respectively.
          The -mm or -ms option causes the utility to interpret
          macros so that only running text is output (that is,
          text from macro lines is not output).  The -ml option
          forces the -mm option and causes deletion of lists
          associated the the mm macros.

     -w   Causes output of a word list, one word per line, with
          all other characters deleted.  A word is defined as any
          string that contains at least two letters and is
          composed of letters, digits, ampersands, and
          apostrophes.  In a macro call, however, a word is a
          string that begins with at least two letters and
          contains a total of at least three letters.  Delimiters
          are any characters other than letters, digits,
          apostrophes, and ampersands.  The utility removes
          trailing apostrophes and ampersands from words.

SEE ALSO
     spell(1).

NOTES
     The deroff utility is not a complete troff interpreter and
     can make errors when encountering subtle constructs.  Most
     such errors result in too much rather than too little
     output.

     The -ml option does not handle nested lists correctly.

     An ' (apostrophe) in column one of the file will be removed
     with the character to its right.

     The deroff utility also removes words of two or fewer
     letters in lines that begin with macro calls or troff
     requests.
