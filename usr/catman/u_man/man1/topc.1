TOPC(1T)						 TOPC(1T)

NAME
     topc - Transfers a file to a destination computer from a
     System 1000 Series computer

SYNOPSIS
     topc -bdrtx unixfile pcfile

DESCRIPTION
     The topc command transfers a file to a destination computer
     from a System 1000 Series computer.  The destination
     computer can be a Texas Instruments Professional computer
     (TIPC) running the 931 terminal emulator package, version
     2.0 or higher, or a TI BUSINESS-PRO(TM) running the 924
     terminal emulator package, or any IBM(R)-compatible computer
     running the 924 emulator.

     To abort a file transfer, press the Command key of the 931
     or 924 emulator.

   Options
     -b   Sends the data as binary and does not insert carriage
	  returns.   Without this option, each newline character
	  has a carriage return inserted prior to it (the format
	  for MS(R)-DOS text files).

     -d dev
	  Allows the file transfer to be initiated from one
	  terminal with the actual transfer occurring from a
	  terminal attached to the device specified by dev.  Only
	  the super-user can specify this option.  The device dev
	  cannot be in use by any other process, including getty
	  and the shell.  The devadm(1T) utility should be used
	  to turn off the device.    Use devadm to specify off in
	  the action field of the devadm display, and set Auto
	  Init to no.

     -r   Replaces the destination file if it already exists.

     -t nn
	  Set time-out to nn seconds to receive characters from
	  the emulator.  The allowed range for nn is 5 to 256.
	  If this option is not specified, the default value is
	  10 seconds.

     -x filename
	  Creates a file named filename and places in the file a
	  trace of the file transfer.  This option should be used
	  when a file transfer problem is encountered and should
	  be reported to Texas Instruments.

   Arguments
     unixfile  The name of the file to transfer from the System
	       1000 Series computer.  This name can be a path
	       name.

     pcfile    The name that the transferred file will have on
	       the destination computer.  The file name and path
	       name combined cannot exceed 40 characters in
	       length.	To enter a backslash, \, in a destination
	       file path name, enter either two backslashes, \\,
	       or a single forward slash, /.

EXAMPLES
     The following command transfers a System 1000 Series binary
     file named binfile in the current working directory to a
     destination file named \scratch\binfile.  The -b option
     prevents carriage returns from being inserted prior to
     newline characters.

	  topc -b -r binfile \\scratch\\binfile
