TOISAM(1T)						 TOISAM(1T)

NAME
     toisam - Copies sequential data to an existing T-ISAM file

SYNOPSIS
     toisam -BefFns data_file [index_file]

DESCRIPTION
   Purpose
     The toisam command writes data from a specified sequential
     (flat) file to a T-ISAM file.

   Discussion
     If index_file is specified, it will be used. If it is not
     specified, the index file associated with the data file will
     be used.

   Options
     -B      Like -F, except fills with spaces rather than nulls.

     -e      Provides exclusive access while the T-ISAM file is
	     written and returns a file locked error if the T-
	     ISAM file is currently open by another process.

     -f file Reads input from file.  If this option is not
	     specified, input is read from standard input.

     -F      Fills record to siz (if -s is specified) or to
	     maximum record size for the file with nulls. This is
	     meaningful only if -n is selected.

     -n      Uses new-line characters to separate records. When a
	     new-line character is encountered in the input, the
	     existing data will be written to the T-ISAM file as
	     a complete record. The data following the new-line
	     character will be the beginning of the next record
	     to be written.

	     If a new-line character is not encountered and
	     enough data has been read to fill a maximum sized
	     record (as defined by the -s option or, in the
	     absence of a -s option, the maximum record size for
	     the T-ISAM file), the existing data will be written
	     as a record and subsequent data up to the next new-
	     line character will be discarded.

	     If -n is not specified, input data is assumed to
	     consist of records that are the maximum record size.

	     In all cases, any data not written to the T-ISAM
	     file when end of file is reached on the input will
	     be written as a final T-ISAM record.

     -s siz  Uses a (maximum) record size of siz. If this is not
	     declared, the maximum record size of the T-ISAM file
	     will be used.

EXAMPLE
     The following example copies data from the file datafile to
     the T-ISAM file tismfile.dat (using the index specified by
     tismfile.dat). Each 100 bytes of input (and any data
     remaining after end of file is reached on the input file)
     will constitute a T-ISAM record. If the input data contains
     new-line characters, they will be regarded as data.

	  toisam -f datafile -s 100 tismfile.dat

     In the following example, data is read from datfile and
     written to the T-ISAM file with data in tismfile.dat and
     index in tismfile.idx. New-line characters constitute data
     separators.

	  toisam -n tismfile.dat tismfile.idx < datfile

PROMPTS
   T-ISAM Data File:
     Enter the data portion of the T-ISAM file.

   T-ISAM Index File:
     Optional. Enter the index portion of the T-ISAM file. If
     this is omitted, the index associated with the T-ISAM data
     file will be used.

   Input File:
     Identify the sequential file to be copied to the T-ISAM
     file.

   Record Size:
     Optional. This is the (maximum) size of input records. If
     Newline Record Separators (below) is selected, records
     larger than this size will be truncated. If Newline Record
     Separators is not selected, toisam will assume that a new
     record begins at each multiple of this number. If this entry
     is omitted, the Maximum Record Size for the T-ISAM file will
     be used.

   Newline Record Separators? (y/n):
     If this is selected, new-line characters (ASCII CR) will
     always be interpreted as record separators.

   Null or Blank Fill (n/b/):
     The default is no response (indicating no fill). If n or b
     is selected and Newline Record Separators (above) is
     selected, records will be padded with nulls or spaces until
     the Record Size (as defined above) or the file's maximum
     record size is reached.

   Exclusive Access? (y/n):
     If this is selected, the T-ISAM file will be opened for
     exclusive access.	If the file is already opened, this
     utility will fail. Any attempt to open the T-ISAM file while
     this utility is using it will fail.
