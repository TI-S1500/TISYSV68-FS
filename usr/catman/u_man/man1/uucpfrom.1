UUCPFROM(1T)					     UUCPFROM(1T)

NAME
     uucpfrom - Retrieves files from a remote system via uucp(1C)

SYNOPSIS
     uucpfrom srcfile sitename destfile
     uucpfrom srcfile all destfile
     uucpfrom sitename

DESCRIPTION
   Purpose
     The uucpfrom command copies files named srcfile located on
     the remote system named sitename to the file, destfile, on
     the local system.

   Discussion
     Prior to invoking uucp to perform the file transfer,
     uucpfrom performs preliminary checks to ensure that lock
     files do not currently exist, that the remote system is
     currently defined, and that other checks are valid (such as
     checking that the file or directory is valid and readable).
     If the all parameter is specified instead of a site name,
     the uucp daemon, uucico, is activated to perform all work
     files currently queued for execution.  If only the site name
     parameter is specified, uucico contacts the system,
     sitename, and performs all work requests queued at the local
     and remote sites concerning the two systems.

FILES
     /usr/spool/uucp	 Spool directory

     /usr/lib/uucp/*	 uucp configuration and program files

SEE ALSO
     uucico(1C), uucp(1C), uucpto(1T).

DIAGNOSTICS
     Messages are displayed to inform the user that certain lock
     or status files are being removed.  Other messages are
     displayed to inform the user of error or success conditions
     in queueing or activation of the uucp daemon.

NOTES
     If the uucp daemon, uucico, is not currently active when
     uucpfrom is activated, all lock and status files for the
     device and system being accessed will be removed.	If uucico
     is active, the request will be queued for execution, unless
     only the site name is provided, in which case a message is
     displayed informing the user to try later.

     To verify that the specified files were transferred, inspect
     the uucp log file, /usr/spool/uucp/LOGFILE.
