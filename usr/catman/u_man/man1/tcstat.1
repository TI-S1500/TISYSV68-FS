NAME
     tcstat - Lists status of network terminal concentrators

SYNOPSIS
     tcstat -w [tcnames]

DESCRIPTION
   Function
     The tcstat command lists information about the specified
     network terminal concentrators (NTCs).  This command sends a
     status request to each NTC to get the most recent status
     information.  The tcstat command can be used to determine if
     the NTC is currently operational and running with the
     correct software and hardware versions.

   Arguments
     tcnames
	    An NTC global name or a list of NTC global names as
	    specified in the NTC definition file, /etc/tctab.
	    Without tcnames specified, the command lists the
	    status information of all the NTCs defined in the NTC
	    definition file, /etc/tctab.

   Options
     -w     Updates the NTC definition file /etc/tctab with the
	    current information in the NTC information table kept
	    by the NTC download process.  If the auto-config
	    option of the NTC download utility is used, this
	    option replaces any unknown 48-bit host addresses in
	    the file with the real 48-bit host addresses.  (See
	    tcdl(1T).  The auto-config option is -a.)  Thus,
	    possible manual editing errors are avoided.

EXAMPLES
     The following are example command lines for the tcstat
     command:

	  tcstat payroll tc0
	  tcstat
	  tcstat -w

     The following is an example of status information returned
     by tcstat upon normal completion:

     NAME  STATUS	 ROM	 PORT15-0  CCB	NETWORK   HOST ADDR	DUMP
     tc0   : RAM 0115*A  115.86  0000	   03	00000000  080028000801
     tc1   : RAM 0115*A  134.86  0000	   03	00000000  0800280005D0	enabled
     junk  : OFFLINE			   03	000124FD  080011111111

     The meanings of the columns are as follows:

     NAME	  NTC global name.  Maximum length is 8
		  characters.

     STATUS	  The current running state of the NTC.  There
		  are 6 possible status conditions returned by
		  the utility:

		  WAITING - The NTC is running in the ROM
		  download code.  A download request is sent out
		  of the NTC every 60 seconds.	The download
		  process, tcdl, on the download server host
		  system has not responded to the download
		  request yet.

		  DNLDING - The NTC is running in the ROM
		  download code.  The download is in progress.

		  UPLDING - The NTC is sending the memory dump to
		  the host.  The NTC is running in the ROM
		  download code. The download will be started
		  when the memory dump is finished.

		  RAM version - The NTC is running in the
		  downloaded code (RAM) and is operational.  The
		  version number of the downloaded software is
		  displayed.

		  OFFLINE - No response has been received from
		  the NTC.  This may indicate that the NTC is
		  powered off or has encountered software or
		  hardware problems.  Further investigation into
		  the cause for the status is needed.

		  UNKNOWN - The status returned from the NTC is
		  not valid.  The NTC might need to be downloaded
		  again.  Further investigation into the cause
		  for the status is needed.

     ROM	  The version number of the ROM in the NTC is
		  displayed.  This is the Julian date of the ROM
		  code.

     PORT15-0	  A 16-bit hexadecimal value that indicates the
		  self-test results of the 16 asynchronous ports
		  on the NTC, one bit for each port.  If bit n is
		  1, port n failed the self-test.  For example,
		  0090 means that port 4 and port 7 failed the
		  self-test; 0000 means that all 16 ports passed
		  the self-test.

     CCB	  The chassis slot number of the communications
		  carrier board (CCB) that is associated with the
		  specified NTC.

     NETWORK	  The 32-bit network number of the NTC.  This
		  number indicates the network to which the NTC
		  is attached.	00000000 means the NTC is on the
		  same directly connected network as the host
		  system.

     HOST ADDR	  The 48-bit host address assigned to the NTC.

     DUMP	  If the memory dump capability of that NTC is
		  enabled, the word enabled is displayed.  See
		  tcdump(1T).

DIAGNOSTICS
     The following messages can be displayed by the tcstat
     utility:

     usage: tcstat -[w] [tcname(s)]
     Unable to locate shared memory segment, error =
     Attaching shared memory segment, error =
     Can't open the INET device driver on CCB, err =
     Error from INET device driver on CCB, err =
     tcname is not found in NTC definition file
     tcname has an undefined 48 bit address
     IOCTL ext-read error from CCBx, error =
     Cannot open /tmp/tctemp for writing, error =
