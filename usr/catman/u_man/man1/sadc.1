SADC(1M)						 SADC(1M)

NAME
     sadc - Produces a system activity report

SYNOPSIS
     sadc [t n] [ofile]

DESCRIPTION
   Purpose
     The sadc command samples system data n times every t seconds
     and writes in binary format to ofile or to standard output.
     If t and n are omitted, a special record is written.  This
     facility is used at system boot time to mark the time at
     which the counters restart from zero.

     This activity reporter is called by sa1(1M).

   Discussion
     System activity data can be accessed at the special request
     of a user (see sar(1)).  It can also be accessed
     automatically on a routine basis as described here.  The
     operating system contains counters that are incremented as
     various system actions occur.  These include CPU utilization
     counters, buffer usage counters, disk and tape I/O activity
     counters, TTY device activity counters, switching and
     system-call counters, file-access counters, queue activity
     counters, and counters for interprocess communications.

EXAMPLE
     The following /etc/rc entry writes the special record to the
     daily data file to mark the system restart:

	  "/usr/lib/sa/sadc /usr/adm/sa/sadate +%d&"

   Binary Daily Data File Structure
     The structure of the binary daily data file is as follows:

     struct sa {
	int num_cpu;	    /* number of cpus in chassis */
	struct sysinfo si;  /* see /usr/include/sys/sysinfo.h */
	int  szinode;	    /* current size of inode table  */
	int  szfile;	    /* current size of file table  */
	int  sztext;	    /* current size of text table  */
	int  szproc;	    /* current size of proc table  */
	int  mszinode;	    /* maximum size of inode table  */
	int  mszfile;	    /* maximum size of file table  */
	int  msztext;	    /* maximum size of text table  */
	int  mszproc;	    /* maximum size of proc table  */
	long  inodeovf;     /* cumul. overflows of inode table since boot */
	long  inodeovf;     /* cumul. overflows of file table since boot */
	long  textovf;	    /* cumul. overflows of text table since boot */
	long  procovf;	    /* cumul. overflows of proc table since boot */
	time_t	ts;	    /* time stamp, seconds  */
	long  ramio;	    /* I/O requests to/from ram disk */
	long  ramcnt;	    /* number of blocks transferred from/to ram disk */
	long  devio[NDEVS][4];	/* device info for up to NDEVS units  */
     #define IO_OPS	    0	/* cumul. I/O requests	*/
     #define IO_BCNT	    1	/* cumul. blocks transferred */
     #define IO_ACT	    2	/* cumul. drive busy time in ticks  */
     #define IO_RESP	    3	/* cumul. I/O resp time in ticks  */
     };
