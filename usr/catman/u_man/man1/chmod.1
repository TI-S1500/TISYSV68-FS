CHMOD(1)                                                 CHMOD(1)

NAME
     chmod - Changes mode

SYNOPSIS
     chmod absolute_mode files
     chmod ugoa +-= flrwxst files

DESCRIPTION
   Purpose
     The chmod command changes the permissions of the named files
     according to the mode, which may be absolute or symbolic.

   Options
     absolute_mode
          An absolute mode is an octal number constructed from
          the OR of the following modes:

           04000    Set user ID on execution to the user ID of
                    the owner of the file

           02000    Set group ID on execution to the group ID of
                    the owner of the file

           01000    Set sticky bit, executable code remains
                    resident in memory.  Only the super-user can
                    set this mode, see chmod(2).  This bit will
                    always be set to 0 unless specifically set to
                    1.

          200000    Forced write

           00700    Read, write, execute (search) by owner

           00400    Read by owner

           00200    Write by owner

           00100    Execute (search in directory) by owner

           00070    Read, write, execute (search) by group

           00040    Read by group

           00020    Write by group

           00010    Execute (search in directory) by group

           00007    Read, write, execute (search) by others

           00004    Read by others

           00002    Write by others

           00001    Execute (search in directory) by others

     Symbolic mode

          ugoa      The letter u means user's (owner's)
                    permissions, g means group's permissions, and
                    o means other's permissions.  The letter a
                    stands for ugo and is the default if u, g, o,
                    or a is omitted.

          +-=       The + means to add a permission to the file's
                    mode, - means to take away a permission, and
                    = means to assign a permission absolutely
                    (all other bits will be reset).

          flrwxst   The f means make the file forced-write, r
                    means make the file readable, w means make
                    the file writeable, x means make the file
                    executable, s means to set owner or group ID,
                    t means to save text (the executable code of
                    the program, not the data or stack), and l
                    means that mandatory locking will occur
                    during file access.  Omitting f, l, r, w, x,
                    s, or t is useful only with = to take away
                    all permissions.

                    You must use chmod -f file to turn off forced
                    write.

                    Mandatory file and record blocking (l)
                    refers to a file's ability to have its
                    reading or writing permissions locked while a
                    program is accessing that file.  It is not
                    possible to permit group execution and enable
                    a file to be locked on execution at the same
                    time.  In addition, it is not possible to
                    turn on the set-group-ID and enable a file to
                    be locked on execution at the same time.  The
                    following examples,

                         chmod g+x,+1 file
                         chmod g+s,+1 file

                    are, therefore, illegal usages and will
                    elicit error messages.

   Discussion
     Multiple symbolic modes separated by commas can be given.
     Operations are performed in the order specified.  The letter
     s is only useful with u or g.  The letter t only works with
     u.

     Only the owner of a file (or the super-user) can change its
     mode.

EXAMPLES
          chmod 755 file1

     The previous command changes the mode of a file you own to:

     + Read, write, execute (400+200+100) by owner

     + Read, execute (40+10) by group

     + Read, execute (4+1) by others

     Running the ls -l command on file1 displays the following,
     showing that the requested mode is in effect:

          -rwxr-xr-x

     The following command deletes all rwx permissions from the
     file named file1 but leaves existing s or t
     permissions:

          chmod = file1

     The following example denies write permission for the file
     named file2 to others and grants write permission to the
     group:

          chmod o-w,g+w file2

     The following example makes the files named a, b, and c
     executable:

          chmod +x a b c

     The following example causes a file to be locked during
     access:

          chmod +l file1

     The following two command lines are equivalent:

          chmod go+r file3

          chmod g+r,o+r file3

PROMPTS
   File Name(s):
     Enter the name of the file or files to be processed.  Enter
     more than one file with a space between file names.

   New mode:
     Enter the octal number that specifies the desired absolute
     mode.
