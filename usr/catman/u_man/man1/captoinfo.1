CAPTOINFO(1M)                                       CAPTOINFO(1M)

NAME
     captoinfo - Converts a termcap description into a
     terminfo(4) description

SYNOPSIS
     captoinfo -Vv1 termcapfile

DESCRIPTION
   Purpose
     captoinfo looks in file for termcap descriptions and then,
     for each description it finds, writes to standard output an
     equivalent terminfo description along with any comments or
     messages.

   Options
     -V   Prints version of program in use on standard error and
          exits.

     -v[2]
          Prints tracing information on standard error as the
          program runs. Specifying 2 prints more detailed
          information.

     -1   Causes the fields to be printed one to a line.
          Otherwise, several terminfo entries will be printed on
          a line.

   Discussion
     You can redirect standard output to a file, but messages
     will still appear on the screen. If file is not specified,
     captoinfo uses the environment variable TERMCAP for the file
     name. If TERMCAP is not set, captoinfo reads the file
     /etc/termcap.

     Certain termcap defaults are assumed to be true. For
     example, the bell character (terminfo bel) is assumed to be
     ^G. The linefeed capability (termcap nl) is assumed to be
     the same for both cursor_down and scroll_forward (terminfo
     cud1 and ind, respectively). Padding information is assumed
     to belong at the end of the string.

     The algorithm used to expand parameterized information for
     termcap fields such as cursor_position (termcap cm, terminfo
     cup) sometimes produces a string that, though technically
     correct, may not be optimal. In particular, the rarely used
     termcap operation %n produces strings that are especially
     long. Most occurrences of these non-optimal strings will be
     flagged with a warning message and may need to be recoded by
     hand.

     The short two-letter name at the beginning of the list of
     names in a termcap entry has been removed.

DIAGNOSTICS
     tgetent failed with return code n (reason).
          The termcap entry is not valid. In particular, check
          for an invalid tc= entry.

     unknown type given for the termcap code cc.
          The termcap description had an entry for cc whose type
          was not boolean, numeric, or string.

     wrong type given for the boolean (numeric, string) termcap code cc.
          The boolean termcap entry cc was entered as a numeric
          or string capability.

     the boolean (numeric, string) termcap code cc is not a valid name.
          An unknown termcap code was specified.

     tgetent failed on TERM=term.
          The terminal type specified could not be found in the
          termcap file.

     TERM=term: cap cc (info ii) is NULL: REMOVED
          The termcap code was specified as a null string. The
          correct way to cancel an entry is with an '@', as in
          ':bs@:'. Giving a null string could cause incorrect
          assumptions to be made by the software that uses
          termcap or terminfo.

     a function key for cc was specified with the value, but it already                has the vlaue vv.
          When parsing the ko capability, the key cc was
          specified as having the same value as the capability
          cc, but the key cc already had a value assigned to it.

     the unknown termcap name cc was specified in the ko termcap capability.
          A key was specified in the ko capability that could not
          be handled.

     the vi character v (info ii) has the value xx,
          but ma gives n.  The ma capability specified a function
          key with a value different from that specified in
          another setting of the same key.

     the unknown vi key v was specified in the ma termcap capability.
          A vi(1) key unknown to captoinfo was specified in the
          ma capability.

     Warning: termcap sg and termcap ug had different values.
          terminfo assumes that the sg (now xmc) and ug values
          were the same.

     Warning: the string produced for ii may be inefficient.
          The parameterized string being created should be
          rewritten by hand.

     Null termname given.
          The terminal type was null. This is given if the
          environment variable TERM is not set or is null.

     cannot open file for reading.
          The specified file could not be opened.
