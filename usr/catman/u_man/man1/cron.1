CRON(1M)						 CRON(1M)

NAME
     cron - Provides a clock daemon

SYNOPSIS
     cron

DESCRIPTION
     The cron command executes commands at specified dates and
     times according to the instructions in files in the
     directory /usr/spool/cron/crontabs.  See crontab(1) for the
     format of the crontabs file.

     Because cron never exits, it should be executed only once.
     The best way to execute cron is to run it from the
     initialization process through the file /etc/rc.  See
     init(1M).

     cron only examines crontab files and at command files during
     process initialization and when a file changes via crontab
     or at. This reduces the overhead of checking for new or
     changed files at regularly scheduled intervals.

SEE ALSO
     at(1), batch(1), crontab(1), init(1M), nice(1), sh(1).

DIAGNOSTICS

     /usr/lib/cron/log.
