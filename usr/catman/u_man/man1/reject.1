REJECT(1M)                                             REJECT(1M)

NAME
     reject - Prevents LP requests

SYNOPSIS
     /usr/lib/reject [-r[reason]] destinations

DESCRIPTION
     reject prevents lp(1) from accepting requests for the named
     destinations.  A destination can be either a printer or a
     class of printers.  Use lpstat(1) to find the status of
     destinations.  The following option is useful with reject.

     -r[reason]    Associates a reason with preventing lp from
                   accepting requests.  This reason applies to
                   all printers mentioned up to the next -r
                   option.  reason is reported by lp when users
                   direct requests to the named destinations and
                   by lpstat(1).  If the -r option is not present
                   or the -r option is given without a reason, a
                   default reason will be used.  If reason contains
                   embedded blanks, you must enclose reason in
                   double quotes.
