CP(1)                                                       CP(1)

NAME
     cp - Copies files

SYNOPSIS
     cp file1 [ file2 ...] target

DESCRIPTION
   Purpose
     The file file1 is copied to target.

   Discussion
     Under no circumstance can file1 and target be the same.  If
     target is a directory, one or more files are copied to that
     directory.  If target already exists, its contents are
     destroyed.

     If target is not an existing file, a new file is created
     that has the same mode as file1 except that the sticky bit
     is not copied.  (If you are super-user, the sticky bit is
     copied.)  The owner and group of target are those of the
     user.  The last access time of target is set to the time the
     copy was made.

     If target is an existing file, copying a file into target
     does not change the mode, owner, or group of target.  The
     last modification time of target and the last access time of
     file1 are set to the time the copy was made.

     If target is a link to a file, all links remain and the file
     is changed.

EXAMPLE
     The following example copies file1 to a new file called
     newfile and leaves the original file1 intact.

          cp file1 newfile

     The next example makes copies of files a, b, and c in the
     directory newdir.

          cp a b c newdir

PROMPTS
   Source File Name(s):
     Enter the name of the file (or files) to be copied.

   Destination File (or Dir):
     Enter the name of the destination file, the file to contain
     the copied file.  This destination can be a directory.  If
     the destination does not exist, it is created.  If the
     destination is an existing file, the previous contents of
     the file are destroyed.
