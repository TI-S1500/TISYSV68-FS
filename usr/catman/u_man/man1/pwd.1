NAME
     pwd - Prints working directory name

SYNOPSIS
     pwd

DESCRIPTION
   Purpose
     The pwd command prints the path name of the working
     (current) directory.

EXAMPLE
     If you are not sure what directory you are currently in,
     enter the following command:

          pwd

     The output indicates your current working directory and
     might be similar to the following:

          /a/usr/home/rwr

     name, indicate possible file system trouble. These messages
     should be referred to a system programming counselor.
