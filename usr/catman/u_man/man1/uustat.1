UUSTAT(1C)                                             UUSTAT(1C)

NAME
     uustat - Performs a uucp(1) status inquiry and job control

SYNOPSIS
     uustat -cjkmMoOqrsuy

DESCRIPTION
   Purpose
     The uustat command displays the status of, or cancels,
     previously specified uucp(1) commands or provides general
     status on uucp connections to other systems.

   Options
     -chour    Removes status entries older than hour hours.
               This administrative option can be initiated only
               by the user uucp or the super-user.

     -jjobn    Reports the status of the uucp request jobn.  If
               all is used for jobn, the status of all uucp
               requests is reported.  A jobn must be supplied.
               Otherwise, the command usage message is displayed
               and the uustat command fails.

     -kjobn    Kills the uucp request whose job number is jobn.
               The killed uucp request must belong to the person
               issuing the uustat command unless the user is the
               super-user.

     -mmch     Reports the status of accessibility of machine
               mch.  If mch is specified as all, then the status
               of all machines known to the local uucp is
               provided.

     -Mmch     Performs the same task as the -m option except
               that two times are printed:  the time that the
               last status was obtained and the time that the
               last successful transfer to that system occurred.

     -ohour    Reports the status of all uucp requests older than
               hour hours.

     -O        Reports the uucp status using the octal status
               codes listed in the next section.  If this option
               is not specified, the verbose description is
               printed with each uucp request.

     -q        Lists the number of jobs and other control files
               queued for each machine and the time of the oldest
               and youngest file queued for each machine.  If a
               lock file exists for that system, its date of
               creation is listed.

     -rjobn    Rejuvenates jobn. The modification time of jobn is
               set to the current time.  This setting prevents
               uuclean from deleting the job until the job's
               modification time reaches the limit imposed by
               uuclean.

     -ssys     Reports the status of all uucp requests that
               communicate with remote system sys.

     -uuser    Reports the status of all uucp requests issued by
               user.

     -yhour    Reports the status of all uucp requests younger
               than hour hours.

     When no options are given, uustat outputs the status of all
     uucp requests issued by the current user.  Note that the
     options -j, -m, -k, -c, or -r, are mutually exclusive.
