CB(1)                                                       CB(1)

NAME
     cb - Reformats C programs (C beautifier)

SYNOPSIS
     cb -jls files

DESCRIPTION
   Purpose
     The cb command reads C programs and writes them on the
     standard output with spacing and indentation that displays
     the structure of the code.  The command reads the C programs
     either from the command arguments or from the standard
     input.

   Options
     Under default options, cb preserves all user newlines.

     -j   Causes split lines to be put back together.

     -l leng
          The value leng is a number that specifies a line
          length.  The argument causes cb to split lines that are
          longer than this length.

     -s   Alters the code to conform to the style of Kernighan
          and Ritchie in The C Programming Language.

PROMPTS
   Input File Name(s):
     Enter the name of the file to process.

   Output File Name:
     Enter the name of the file to receive the output of the
     command.  The default is standard output.

   Kernighan and Ritchie Style:
     The initial value is no.  Enter yes to alter the C code to
     the style of Kernighan and Ritchie in The C Programming
     Language.

   Join Split Lines:
     The initial value is no.  Enter yes to cause split lines to
     be joined.

   Line Length:
     Enter a number that specifies a line length.  The command
     will split lines longer than this number.

NOTES
     Punctuation that is hidden in preprocessor statements causes
     indentation errors.
