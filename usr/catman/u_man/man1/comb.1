NAME
     comb - Combines SCCS deltas

SYNOPSIS
     comb -cops files

DESCRIPTION
   Purpose
     The comb command generates a shell procedure (see sh(1))
     that, when run, reconstructs the given SCCS files.  The
     reconstructed files should be smaller than the original
     files. Only super-user can use this command.

   Options
     Each option is explained as though only one named file is to
     be processed, but the effects of any option apply
     independently to each named file.

     -clist
	  A list (see get(1) for the syntax of a list) of deltas
	  to be preserved.  All other deltas are discarded.

     -o   For each get -e generated, this argument causes the
	  reconstructed file to be accessed at the release of the
	  delta to be created instead of at the most recent
	  ancestor.  Use of the -o option may decrease the size
	  of the reconstructed SCCS file.  It may also alter the
	  shape of the delta tree of the original file.

     -pSID
	  The SCCS IDentification string (SID) of the oldest
	  delta to be preserved.  All older deltas are
	  discarded in the reconstructed file.

     -s   This argument causes comb to generate a shell procedure
	  which, when run, produces a report giving, for each file:
	  the filename, size (in blocks) after combining, original
	  size (also in blocks), and percentage change computed by:

	  100 * (original - combined) / original

	  Before any SCCS files are actually combined, use this
	  option to determine exactly how much space is saved by
	  the combining process.

     If no options arguments are specified, comb preserves only
     leaf deltas and the minimal number of ancestors needed to
     preserve the tree.

   Discussion
     The arguments can be specified in any order, but all options
     apply to all named SCCS files.  If a directory is named,
     comb behaves as though each file in the directory were
     specified as a named file, except that non-SCCS files (last
     component of the path name does not begin with s.)  and
     unreadable files are silently ignored.  If a name of - is
     given, the standard input is read; each line of the standard
     input is taken to be the name of an SCCS file to be
     processed; non-SCCS files and unreadable files are silently
     ignored.

     The generated shell procedure is written on the standard
     output.

EXAMPLE
     Assume that you have an SCCS file named file1 with the
     following structure:

		     1.3.1.2
		      /
		   1.3.1.1---1.3.2.1---1.3.2.2.
		    /
		   /
     1.1--1.2---1.3---1.4---2.1---2.2---2.3---2.4

     The following example reconstructs the file by discarding
     SIDs 1.2, 1.4, 2.1, 2.3, 2.4, and 1.3.2.1.

	  comb -p2.2 file1

FILES
     comb?????	  Temporary file

DIAGNOSTICS
     Use help(1) for explanations.

NOTES
     The comb command might rearrange the shape of the tree of
     deltas.  It might not save any space; in fact, it is
     possible for the reconstructed file to actually be larger
     than the original.
