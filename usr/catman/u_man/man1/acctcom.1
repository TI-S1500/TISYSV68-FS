ACCTCOM(1)					       ACCTCOM(1)

NAME
     acctcom - Searches and prints process accounting files

SYNOPSIS
     acctcom -abCeEfghHiIklmnoOqrSstuv [files]

DESCRIPTION
   Purpose
     The acctcom command reads file, the standard input, or
     /usr/adm/pacct, in the form described by acct(4) and writes
     selected records to the standard output.

   Options
     -a 	 Shows average statistics about the processes
		 selected.  The statistics are printed after the
		 output records.

     -b 	 Reads backwards, showing latest commands first.
		 This option has no effect when the standard
		 input is read.

     -Csec	 Shows only processes with total CPU time, system
		 time plus user time, exceeding sec seconds.

     -e time	 Selects processes existing at or before time.

     -E time	 Selects processes ending at or before time.
		 Using the same time for both -S and -E shows the
		 processes that existed at time.

     -f 	 Prints the fork/exec flag and system exit status
		 columns in the output.

     -g group	 Shows only processes belonging to group. The
		 group can be designated by either the group ID
		 or group name.

     -h 	 Shows the fraction of total available CPU time
		 consumed by the process during its execution.
		 (The default is to show mean memory size.)  This
		 hog factor is computed as (total CPU time)/
		 (elapsed time).

     -H factor	 Shows only processes that exceed factor, where
		 factor is the hog factor explained in option -h.

     -i 	 Prints columns containing the I/O counts in the
		 output.

     -I chars	 Shows only processes transferring more
		 characters than the cutoff number given by
		 chars.

     -k 	 Shows total kcore-minutes instead of memory
		 size.

     -l line	 Shows only processes belonging to terminal
		 /dev/line.

     -m 	 Shows mean core size (the default).

     -n pattern  Shows only commands matching pattern that can be
		 a regular expression as in ed(1) except that +
		 means one or more occurrences.

     -o ofile	 Copies selected process records in the input
		 data format to ofile; supresses standard output
		 printing.

     -O sec	 Shows only processes with CPU system time
		 exceeding sec seconds.

     -q 	 Does not print any output records; prints only
		 the average statistics (the same as the -a
		 option).

     -r 	 Shows CPU factor - user time/(system-time +
		 user-time).

     -s time	 Selects processes existing at or after time,
		 given in the format hr[:min[:sec]].

     -S time	 Selects processes starting at or after time.

     -t 	 Shows separate system and user CPU times.

     -u user	 Shows only processes belonging to user that can
		 be specified by one of the following: a user ID,
		 a login name that is then converted to a user
		 ID, a # that designates only those processes
		 executed with super-user privileges, or ?  which
		 designates only those processes associated with
		 unknown user IDs.

     -v 	 Excludes column headings from the output.

   Discussion
     Each record that acctcom writes to the standard output
     represents the execution of one process.  The output column
     heading are as follows:
	  COMMAND
	  NAME
	  USER
	  TTYNAME
	  START
	  TIME
	  END
	  TIME
	  REAL (SEC)
	  CPU (SEC)
	  MEAN
	  SIZE(K)

     The following headings appear if specified by the
     appropriate command option:
	  F (the fork/exec flag, a 1 indicates a fork(2)
	    without an exec(2))
	  STAT (the system exit status)
	  HOG FACTOR
	  KCORE MIN
	  CPU FACTOR
	  CHARS TRNSFD
	  BLOCKS /WD (total blocks read and written)

     The command name reported under the COMMAND heading is
     prepended with a # if the command was executed with super-
     user privileges.  If a process is not associated with a
     known terminal, a ? is printed in the TTYNAME field.

     If no files are specified and if the standard input is
     associated with a terminal or /dev/null (as is the case when
     using & in the shell), /usr/adm/pacct is read.  Otherwise,
     the standard input is read.

     The file arguments are read in their respective order.  Each
     file is normally read forward (that is, in chronological
     order) by process completion time.  The file /usr/adm/pacct
     is usually the current file to be examined.  A busy system
     might need several such files, of which all but the current
     file are found in /usr/adm/pacct?.

FILES
     /etc/passwd
     /usr/adm/pacct
     /etc/group

     acct(2), acct(4), acct(1M), ps(1), su(1), utmp(4).

NOTES
     The acctcom command reports only on terminated processes.
     Use ps(1) for active processes.  If time exceeds the present
     time, time is interpreted as occurring on the previous day.
