WAIT(1)                                                   WAIT(1)

NAME
     wait - Waits for the completion of processes

SYNOPSIS
     wait

DESCRIPTION
   Purpose
     The wait command prevents further user input until all
     processes started with & have completed.  At this point,
     abnormal terminations are reported.

     Because the wait(2) system call must be executed in the
     parent process, the shell itself executes wait without
     creating a new process.

SEE ALSO
     bsh(1), sh(1).

NOTES
     This command cannot wait for processes of pipelines with
     three or more stages unless the pipelines are children of
     the shell.

     The command reports the process ID (PID) of background
     processes when wait is interrupted.
