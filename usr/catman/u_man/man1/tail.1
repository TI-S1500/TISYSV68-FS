TAIL(1)                                                   TAIL(1)

NAME
     tail - Delivers the last part of a file

SYNOPSIS
     tail +numberbcl -numberbcl -f [file]

DESCRIPTION
   Purpose
     The tail command copies the named file to the standard
     output, beginning at a designated place.  If no file is
     named, the standard input is used.  If no options are
     specified, tail copies the last ten lines of the file.

   Options
     The options b, c, and l must be appended to the + or -
     number option.

     +number
          Begins copying at location +number of the input.  (If
          number is null, the value 10 is assumed.)

     -number
          Begins copying at distance -number from the end of the
          input.  (If number is null, the value 10 is assumed.)

     -b   Counts number by blocks.

     -c   Counts number by characters.

     -f   If the input file is not from a pipe, the program will
          not terminate after a line of the input file has been
          copied but will enter an endless loop, wherein it
          sleeps for a second and then attempts to read and copy
          further records from the input file.

     -l   Counts number by lines.

   Discussion
     The -f (follow) option can be used to monitor the growth of
     a file being written by some other process.  For example,
     the following command prints the last ten lines of the file
     fred, followed by any lines that are appended to fred
     between the time tail is initiated and killed:

          tail -f fred

     As another example, the following command prints the last 15
     characters of the file fred, followed by any lines that are
     appended to fred between the time tail is initiated and
     killed:

          tail -15cf fred

     Note that the options c and f are appended to the count, 15.

PROMPTS
   Input File Name:
     Enter the name of the file to be viewed.

   Continuous Update:
     Initial value is no.

   Copying Distance:
     Default is 10.  Enter the number of the line from which to
     begin copying the input file.

   From Beginning or End of Input (b,e):
     Enter b to begin copying from the beginning of a file.
     Enter e to begin copying from the end of a file.

   Count by Blocks, Char, Lines(b,c,l):
     Enter b to count units of blocks.  Enter c to count
     characters.  Enter l to count lines.

   Listing Access Name:
     Enter the name of a file to contain the output (listing) of
     this command.

SEE ALSO
     show(1T).

NOTES
     Tails relative to the end of the file are saved in a 10K
     byte buffer, and thus are limited in length.  Various kinds
     of anomalous behavior may happen with character special
     files.

     If the output of a program is piped to tail, tail will not
     output the request until the program is complete.  Thus, the
     command that follows might tie up the terminal several
     minutes with no output until tar(1) completes.  Even the -f
     option does not help.

          tar cf . | tail

     You can accomplish the task with two commands:

          tar cbf 10 . > taroutput &
          tail -f taroutput
