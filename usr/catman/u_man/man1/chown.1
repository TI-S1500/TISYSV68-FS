CHOWN(1)                                                 CHOWN(1)

NAME
     chown - Changes owner

SYNOPSIS
     chown owner files

DESCRIPTION
   Purpose
     The chown program changes the owner of the files to owner.
     The owner may be either a decimal user ID or a login name
     found in the password file.

   Discussion
     When ownership is changed by an ordinary user, the set-
     user-ID bit (04000) and the set-group-ID bit (02000) are
     cleared.  If the super-user changes ownership, these bits
     are retained.

     The new owner name or user ID must be in the /etc/passwd
     file.

     Only the current owner or the super-user can change the
     owner of a file.

PROMPTS
   File Name(s):
     Enter the name of the file to be processed.  Enter more than
     one file name with a space between the names.

   New owner:
     Enter the login name of the new owner.

FILES
     /etc/passwd

SEE ALSO
     chmod(1), chown(2), passwd(4).
