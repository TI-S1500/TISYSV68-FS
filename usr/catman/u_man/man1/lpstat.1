LPSTAT(1)                                               LPSTAT(1)

NAME
     lpstat - Prints information about the status of the LP print
     service

SYNOPSIS
     lpstat [options]

DESCRIPTION
     lpstat prints information about the current status of the LP
     print service.

     If no options are given, lpstat prints the status of all
     requests made to lp(1) by users.  Any arguments that are not
     options are assumed to be request IDs (as returned by lp),
     printers, or printer classes.  lpstat prints the status of
     such requests, printers, or printer classes.  Options can
     appear in any order and can be repeated and intermixed with
     other arguments.  Some of the keyletters that follow can be
     followed by an optional list that can be in one of two
     forms:  a list of items separated from one another by a
     comma, or a list of items enclosed in double quotes and
     separated from one another by a comma and/or one or more
     spaces.  For example:

          -u user1, user2, user3

     Specifying all after any keyletters that take list as an
     argument causes all information relevant to the keyletter to
     be printed.  For example, the command

          lpstat -o all

     prints the status of all output requests.

     -a [list]    Displays acceptance status (with respect to lp)
                  of destinations for requests (see accept(1M)).
                  list is a list of intermixed printer names and
                  class names; the default is all.

     -c [list]    Displays class names and their members.  list
                  is a list of class names; the default is all.

     -d           Display the system default destination for lp.

     -f [list] [-l]
                  Displays a verification that the forms in list
                  are recognized by the LP print service.  list
                  is a list of forms; the default is all.  The -l
                  option will list the form descriptions.

     -o [list] [-l]
                  Displays the status of output requests.  list
                  is a list of intermixed printer names, class
                  names, and request IDs; the default is all.
                  The -l option gives a more detailed status of
                  the request.

     -p [list] [-D] [-l]
                  Displays the status of printers named in list.
                  list is a list of printers; the default is all.
                  If the -D option is given, a brief description
                  is printed for each printer in list.  If the -l
                  option is given, a full description of each
                  printer's configuration is given, including the
                  form mounted, the acceptable content and
                  printer types, a printer description, the
                  interface used, and so on.

     -r           Displays the status of the LP request
                  scheduler.

     -s           Displays a status summary, including the system
                  default destination, a list of class names and
                  their members, a list of printers and their
                  associated devices, a list of all forms
                  currently mounted, and a list of all recognized
                  character sets and print wheels.

     -S [list] [-l]
                  Displays a verification that the character sets
                  or the print wheels specified in list are
                  recognized by the LP print service.  Items in
                  list can be character sets or print wheels; the
                  default for the list is all.  If the -l option
                  is given, each line is appended by a list of
                  printers that can handle the print wheel or
                  character set.  The list also shows whether the
                  print wheel or character set is mounted or
                  specifies the built-in character set into which
                  it maps.

     -t           Displays all status information.

                  users.  list is a list of log-in names; the

                  names of the devices associated with them.
