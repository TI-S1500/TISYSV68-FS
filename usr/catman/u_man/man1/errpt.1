ERRPT(1M)                                               ERRPT(1M)

NAME
     errpt - Generates a report of logged errors

SYNOPSIS
     errpt -adefprs

DESCRIPTION
   Purpose
     The errpt command generates a report of data collected by
     the error-logging mechanism errdemon(1M).  The default
     report is a summary of all errors posted in the error file
     (or files) specified with the -f option.  The error file is
     either /usr/adm/errfile or /usr/adm/errfile.old or both.

   Options
     A summary report can be limited to certain records with the
     following options:

     -a          Produces a detailed report that includes all
                 error types.  This option overrides the other
                 options except for page limiting and error file
                 selection.

     -d devlist  Produces a detailed report limited to data about
                 devices given in devlist, where devlist is a
                 list of device path names separated from one
                 another by a space.  The errpt command is
                 familiar with common device path names such as
                 /dev/rqt/0h.

     -e date     Produces a detailed report that ignores all
                 records posted later than date, where date has
                 the form mmddhhmmyy, consistent in meaning with
                 the date (1) command.

     -f b or o   Specifies which error file to use.  The default
                 (no -f option) is /usr/adm/errfile.  The o value
                 specifies /usr/adm/errfile.old.  The b value
                 specifies both /usr/adm/errfile.old and
                 /usr/adm/errfile.

     -p n        Limits the size of a detailed report to n pages.

     -r          In a detailed report, limits the reporting of
                 block device errors to retried errors.

     -s date     Produces a detailed report that ignores all
                 records posted earlier than date, where date has
                 the form mmddhhmmyy, consistent in meaning with
                 the date(1) command.

   Discussion
     A summary report notes the options that may limit its
     completeness and records the time stamped on the earliest
     and latest errors encountered.  The number of times that
     errpt has difficulty reading input data is included in the
     number of read errors.

     Any detailed report contains, in addition to specific error
     information, all instances of the error-logging process
     being started and stopped, and any time changes performed
     with date(1)) that took place during the interval being
     processed.
