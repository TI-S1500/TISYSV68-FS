UNGET(1)                                                 UNGET(1)

NAME
     unget - Undoes a previous get(1) of an SCCS file

SYNOPSIS
     unget -nrs files

DESCRIPTION
   Purpose
     The unget command reverses the effect of a get -e executed
     prior to creating the intended new delta.

   Options
     The following options apply independently to each named
     file:

     -n     Causes the retention of the gotten file, which would
            normally be removed from the current directory.

     -rSID  Uniquely identifies which delta is no longer
            intended.  (This delta would have been specified by
            get as the new delta).  The use of this option is
            necessary only if two or more outstanding gets for
            editing on the same SCCS file were done by the same
            person (login name).  A diagnostic message results if
            the specified SID is ambiguous, or if it is necessary
            and omitted on the command line.

     -s     Suppresses the printout of the intended delta's SID
            on the standard output.

   Discussion
     If a directory is named, unget behaves as though each file
     in the directory were specified as a named file, except that
     non-SCCS files and unreadable files are silently ignored.
     If a name of - is given, the standard input is read with
     each line being taken as the name of an SCCS file to be
     processed.

EXAMPLE
     A user executes two get -e (get with intent to edit)
     commands on SIDs 1.3 and 1.4 of the SCCS file s.file1, but
     does not execute a delta command.  The user now wants to
     execute a delta on SID 1.4 only.  The following command
     cancels the get -e command on SID 1.3:

          unget -r1.3 s.file1

PROMPTS
   Input File Name(s):
     Enter the names of the files to process.

   Retain the Gotten File:
     The initial value is no.  Enter yes to retain rather than
     remove the gotten file.

   Delta Version Number:
     Enter the SID of the delta to process.

   Suppress Output:
     The initial value is no.  Enter yes to suppress printing of
     the SID on the standard output.
