DELTA(1)						 DELTA(1)

NAME
     delta - Makes a delta (change) to an SCCS file

SYNOPSIS
     delta -gmnprsy files

DESCRIPTION
   Purpose
     The delta command is used to permanently introduce into the
     named SCCS file changes that were made to the file retrieved
     by get(1), called the g-file or generated file.

   Options
     Options apply independently to each named file.

     -glist
	  Specifies a list (see get(1) for the definition of
	  list) of deltas that are to be ignored when the file is
	  accessed at the change level (SID) created by this
	  delta.

     -mmrlist
	  Specifies a string consisting of one or more
	  Modification Request (MR) numbers, mrlist, that gives
	  the reason for creating the new delta.  If the SCCS
	  file has the v flag set (see admin(1)), you must
	  specify the mrlist.
	  If -m is not used and the standard input is a terminal,
	  the prompt MRs? is issued on the standard output before
	  the standard input is read; if the standard input is
	  not a terminal, no prompt is issued.	The MRs? prompt
	  always precedes the comments? prompt (see -y
	  keyletter).
	  MRs in a list are separated by blanks and/or tab
	  characters.  An unescaped newline character terminates
	  the MR list.
	  Note that if the v flag has a value (see admin(1)), it
	  is taken to be the name of a program (or shell
	  procedure) for validating the correctness of the MR
	  numbers.  If a non-zero exit status is returned from
	  the MR number validation program, delta terminates (it
	  is assumed that the MR numbers were not all valid).

     -n   Specifies retention of the edited g-file (normally
	  removed at completion of delta processing).

     -p   Causes delta to print (on the standard output) the
	  differences in the SCCS file after the delta is applied
	  in a diff(1) format.	Also produces a script not usable
	  by ed.

     -rSID
	  Requires you to specify a value.  The value is the SID
	  that uniquely identifies which delta is to be made to
	  the SCCS file.  The use of this option is necessary
	  only if two or more outstanding gets for editing (get
	  -e) on the same SCCS file were done by the same person
	  (login name).  The SID value specified with the -r
	  option can be either the SID specified on the get
	  command line or the SID to be made as reported by the
	  get command (see get(1)).  A diagnostic message results
	  if the specified SID is ambiguous or if it is necessary
	  but omitted on the command line.

     -s   Suppresses the issue, on the standard output, of the
	  created delta's SID, as well as the number of lines
	  inserted, deleted and unchanged in the SCCS file.

     -ycomment
	  Specifies text used to describe the reason for making
	  the delta.

	  If -y is not specified and the standard input is a
	  terminal, the prompt comments? is issued on the
	  standard output before the standard input is read. If
	  the standard input is not a terminal, no prompt is
	  issued.  An unescaped newline character terminates the
	  comment text.

	  Comments are limited to text strings of at most 512
	  characters.

   Discussion
     The delta command makes a delta to each named SCCS file.  If
     a directory is named, delta behaves as though each file in
     the directory were specified as a named file, except that
     non-SCCS files (last component of the path name does not
     begin with s.)  and unreadable files are silently ignored.
     If a name of - is given, the standard input is read (see
     NOTES); each line of the standard input is taken to be the
     name of an SCCS file to be processed.

     The delta program may issue prompts on the standard output
     depending upon certain options specified and flags (see
     admin(1)) that may be present in the SCCS file (see -m and
     -y in the Options section above).

EXAMPLE
     The following example creates a new version of the SCCS file
     called s.file1.  Comments and the Modification Request
     number are entered on the command line.

	  delta -yThis delta is in response to STR27. -mSTR27 s.file1

PROMPTS
   File Name(s):
     The SCCS file to be changed.

   Give Delta (revision) Number:
     Optional. Enter the SID number of the specified file.

   Run in Silent Mode:
     The initial value is no.  Enter yes to suppress command
     messages announcing the delta's SID, and the number of lines
     inserted, deleted, and unchanged.

   Delta(s) to be Ignored:
     Optional.	Enter a list of deltas to be ignored when the
     SCCS file is accessed at the change level (SID) created by
     this delta.

   Additional Comments:
     Optional. Enter the reason for making the change.

   Modification Request Number:
     Optional. Enter the modification request number.

   List Differences:
     The initial value is no.  Enter yes to print the file
     differences before and after the change.

   Retain Edited g-File:
     The initial value is no.  Enter yes to retain the edited g-file.

FILES
     All files of the form ?-file are explained in the ``Source
     Code Control System'' section of the TI System V User's
     Guide.  The naming convention for these files is also
     described there.

     g-file	      Existed before the execution of delta;
		      removed after completion of delta.
     p-file	      Existed before the execution of delta; may
		      exist after completion of delta.
     q-file	      Created during the execution of delta;
		      removed after completion of delta.
     x-file	      Created during the execution of delta;
		      renamed to SCCS file after completion of
		      delta.
     z-file	      Created during the execution of delta;
		      removed during the execution of delta.
     d-file	      Created during the execution of delta;
		      removed after completion of delta.
     /usr/bin/bdiff   Program to compute differences between the
		      ``gotten'' file and the g-file .

NOTES
     Lines beginning with an SOH ASCII character (binary 001)
     cannot be placed in the SCCS file unless the SOH is escaped.
     This character has special meaning to SCCS (see sccsfile(5))
     and causes an error.

     A get of many SCCS files, followed by a delta of those
     files, should be avoided when the get generates a large
     amount of data.  Instead, multiple get/delta sequences
     should be used.

     If the standard input (-) is specified on the delta command
     line, the -m (if necessary) and -y options must also be
     present.  Omission of these options causes an error to occur.
