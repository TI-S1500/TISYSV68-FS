LINE(1)                                                   LINE(1)

NAME
     line - Reads one line

SYNOPSIS
     line

DESCRIPTION
     The line command copies one line (up to a newline) from the
     standard input and writes it on the standard output.

     It returns an exit code of 1 on EOF and always prints at
     least a newline.  It is often used within shell files to
     read from the user's terminal.

EXAMPLE
     The following shell script fragment prompts the user for a
     file name, reads the user's response with the line command,
     assigns the response to a variable, and executes the file(1)
     command with that variable as the command argument.

          echo Enter a file name
          name=`line`
          file $name
