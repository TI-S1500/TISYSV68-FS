CHROOT(1M)                                             CHROOT(1M)

NAME
     chroot - Changes the root directory for a command

SYNOPSIS
     chroot newroot command

DESCRIPTION
   Purpose
     The chroot command is restricted to the super-user.  The
     specified command is executed relative to the new root,
     newroot.

   Discussion
     The meaning of initial slashes (/) in path names is changed
     for a command and all its children to newroot.  Furthermore,
     the initial working directory is newroot.

     The following command creates the file x relative to the
     original root, not the new one:

          chroot newroot command >x

     The new root path name is always relative to the current
     root.  Even if a chroot is currently in effect, the newroot
     argument is relative to the current root of the running
     process.

SEE ALSO
     chdir(2).

NOTES
     One should exercise extreme caution when referencing special
     files in the new root file system.
