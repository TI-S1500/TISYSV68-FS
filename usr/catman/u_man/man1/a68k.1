A68K(1T)                                                 A68K(1T)

NAME
     a68k - Invokes the 68020 assembler source processor

SYNOPSIS
     a68k -belstvx file1[,file2 ...]
     a68k -elt =file1[,file2 ...]
     a68k -belstvx [ltx],[prn],[sym]=file1[,file2 ...]

DESCRIPTION
   Purpose
     The a68k command processes one or more TI System V 68020
     assembler source files.  The command produces an
     intermediate linker text (ltx) file for input to the linker
     text conversion utility, ltxcoff(1T).  The a68k command also
     produces a printable assembly listing file as well as an
     optional symbol data file for input to the symbol report
     generator, qsym(1T).

   Options
     -b   Includes both symbol table and cross-reference data in
          the symbol data file read by qsym.  Specifying -b is
          equivalent to specifying both -s and -x on the same
          command line.

     -e   Includes local labels in the linker text file and the
          symbol data file.

     -l   Retains lowercase characters in user-defined symbols.
          Without this option, a68k converts lowercase characters
          to uppercase in user-defined symbols.  The program does
          not distinguish between upper- and lowercase in
          instruction mnemonics, directives mnemonics, and
          register designations.

     -s   Includes symbol table in the symbol data file read by
          qsym.

     -t   Truncates long symbols to 8 characters.  Without this
          option, symbols are truncated to 31 characters.

     -v   Inserts an ASCII formfeed character at the beginning of
          the listing output file.

     -x   Includes cross reference data in the symbol data file
          read by qsym.

   Arguments
     ltx  User-defined linker text output file name.  If no
          suffix is specified, the default file name suffix .ltx
          is appended to this value.

     prn  User-defined assembly listing output file name.  If no
          suffix is specified, the default file name suffix .prn
          is appended to this value.

     sym  User-defined symbol data output file name.  If no
          suffix is specified, the default file name suffix .sym
          is appended to this value.

   Discussion
     The a68k command appends the default file name suffix .a68
     to each listed input file name for which no suffix is
     specified.  Input file names must be separated by commas.

     The default output file name suffixes are .ltx (linker
     text), .prn (assembly listing), and .sym (symbol data).
     Each execution of a68k produces only one output file of each
     type (.ltx, .prn, .sym).

     Specify output file requirements in one of the following
     three ways:

     + If you omit the = from the command line, each output file
       name is derived by adding the appropriate default suffix
       (.ltx, .prn, .sym) to the first input file name in the
       list.

     + If you include the = and specify no user-defined output
       file name, only the linker text file is produced and its
       name is derived as described above.  Options related to
       generation of the assembly listing and symbol data files
       are ignored if specified.

     + If you include the = and one or more user-defined output
       file names, only those files corresponding to the user-
       defined names are produced.  The appropriate default
       suffix (.ltx, .prn, .sym) is appended to each user-defined
       name for which no suffix is specified.

     In the typical case, you can specify a single input file
     that consists of a complete assembly language program
     terminated by an END directive.  Specification of a list of
     input files implies concatenation of several source files
     that will be processed as a single program by a68k,
     resulting in the generation of a single linker text output
     file for the entire group of input files.  The a68k command
     will terminate processing upon encountering an END directive
     in an input file; therefore, only the last input file in the
     list should contain an END directive.

EXAMPLES
     The following example processes the input file lt30.a68 and
     produces the output files lt30.ltx and lt30.prn.

          a68k lt30

     The following example processes the input file lt30.a68 and
     produces the output files lt30.ltx, lt30.prn, and lt30.sym.

          a68k -s lt30

     The following example processes the input file lt30.s and
     produces the output files lt30.ltx, lt30.prn, and lt30.sym.

          a68k -bel lt30.s

     The following example processes the input file lt30.a68 and
     produces the output file lt30.ltx (suppressing lt30.prn).

          a68k =lt30

     The following example processes the input file lt30.a68 and
     produces the output file out.ltx (suppressing lt30.prn).

          a68k out=lt30

     The following example processes the input file lt30.a68 and
     produces the output files lt30.lst and lt30.sym (suppressing
     lt30.ltx).

          a68k -s ,lt30.lst,lt30=lt30

     The following example processes the input file lt30.a68 and
     produces the output files obj.ltx and data.sym (suppressing
     lt30.prn).

          a68k -s obj,,data=lt30
