LTXCOFF(1T)                                           LTXCOFF(1T)

NAME
     ltxcoff - Invokes the 68020 assembler linker text conversion
     utility

SYNOPSIS
     ltxcoff file

DESCRIPTION
   Purpose
     The ltxcoff command converts an intermediate linker text
     (ltx) format file to TI System V Common Object File Format
     (COFF).  The ltxcoff command processes an ltx file created
     by the 68020 assembler source processor as(1T) and produces
     a COFF output file for input to the link editor ld(1) or the
     archive utility ar(1).

   Discussion
     The ltxcoff command appends the default file name suffix
     .ltx to the input file name.  The user is not allowed to
     specify an input file name suffix.

     The ltxcoff command derives the output file name by adding
     .o to the input file name.  The user is not allowed to
     specify any part of the output file name.

     The linker text dump utility, ltxdump(1T) is useful in
     diagnosing error messages produced by ltxcoff.

     See the TI System V 68020 Assembler manual for further
     discussion of the ltx conversion process.  See the TI System
     V Support Tools Guide for information about COFF.
