NETEXEC(1T)                                           NETEXEC(1T)

NAME
     netexec - Executes a background process at a remote site

SYNOPSIS
     netexec -lxy sitename execfile [options]

DESCRIPTION
   Purpose
     The netexec command invokes a background process at a remote
     site. The netexec command requires a server running at the
     remote site.  The server is a daemon named tdts on a System
     1500 or a job named TDTSM on a Business System.

   Options
     -l   This option specifies a remote file that will contain
          the output listing and/or the diagnostic messages from
          the remote execution.

     -x   This option allows you to adjust the time-out value for
          the requests sent to the remote server. The default
          time-out value for each request is 3 seconds times
          internet hop count. It is useful to specify a longer
          time-out value to prevent netexec from abnormal
          termination with time-out error when the remote system
          is very busy. The value specified should be a decimal
          number that indicates the number of seconds. For each
          request sent to the server, the total waiting time is
          (time-out value in seconds) x (number of retries) x
          (internet hop count).

     -y   This option allows you to specify the number of retries
          of each request sent to the remote server. The value
          specified should be a decimal number. The default value
          is 3.

   Arguments
     sitename
          The site name is a character string used to identify a
          node on the network. The maximum length of the site
          name is 8 characters.

     execfile
          The execfile is a remote path name that specifies the
          file to be executed.

     [options]
          The options for the execfile can be specified after the
          execfile in the same format required by a shell
          command.

   Discussion
     In order to provide file access protection on the remote
     system, netexec requires a user ID and a password that are
     valid on the remote system.  The netexec utility scans the
     user ID/password definition file netcp.def in the user's
     home directory to look for the user ID/password definition
     for the specified site name. If the user ID or the password
     cannot be obtained from the file, netexec prompts for this
     information. See netcp(1T) a detailed discussion of the
     netcp.def file.

     Note that the successful completion of netexec only
     indicates that the background execution on the remote site
     is started, not finished.

     When using the netexec command to start a batch execution on
     a remote Business System:

     + The Business System must be a DNOS system with DNIO 2.1.1
       and the job TDTSM installed.

     + The execfile must be a valid input file for the SCI
       command (eXecute Batch). The effect of netexec is the same
       as issuing the XB command with the execfile as the INPUT
       ACCESS NAME parameter.

       The path name specified after the -l option is treated as
       the LISTING ACCESS NAME parameter of the XB command.  The
       LISTING ACCESS NAME is required by the XB command.  Any
       parameters specified for the Business System computer
       batch stream execution are ignored.

     + The batch stream is executed with the privilege level code
       associated with the user ID provided by the user.

     + The Business System site name and path names can be
       specified in either uppercase or lowercase and are
       translated to uppercase for execution on the Business
       System.

     + Business System synonyms and logical names cannot be used
       in the INPUT and LISTING ACCESS names. All synonyms used
       in remote (Business System) batch files must be defined
       within the batch file in which they are used.

     When the netexec utility starts a background process on a
     remote System 1500:

     + The System 1500 has to have the tdts daemon running.

     + The execution access privilege of the execfile is verified
       by using the user ID/password information provided by the
       user.

     + The listing path name is optional.

     The effect of the netexec on the remote system is the same
     as issuing the following commands to the shell:

          execfile options > listing pathname 2>&1 &
          or
          execfile options > /dev/null 2>&1 &

EXAMPLES
   netexec -1/usr/backup.1st s12 /usr/mydiir/backup -b
     This command enables a backup process with parameter -b on
     system s12 running in background and redirects the output
     and diagnostic messages to /usr/backup.1st on system s12.

   netexec -l ds01.1st.install s990 ds01.batch.install
     This command starts the batch execution on file
     ds01.batch.install on system s990. The output listing will
     be put in file ds01.1st.install.

PROMPTS
   Remote Site Name:
     Enter the site name of the remote system where the batch
     execution will be performed.

   Executable File Path Name:
     Enter the file name of the executable file on the remote
     site.

   Listing File Path Name:
     Enter the file name of the execution listing on the remote
     site.

   Execution Parameters:
     Enter the parameters, if there are any, for the remote batch
     execution.

NOTE
     The netexec command requires that at least one CCB has been
     configured with the Xerox Network Systems(TM) (XNS) Internet
     option, entered in response to the Define Transport Protocol
     prompt of the devadm utility.
