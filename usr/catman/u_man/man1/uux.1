UUX(1C)                                                   UUX(1C)

NAME
     uux - Executes UNIX to UNIX commands

SYNOPSIS
     uux -jmnr command-string

DESCRIPTION
   Purpose
     The uux command gathers zero or more files from various
     systems, executes a command on a specified system, and then
     sends standard output to a file on a specified system.

   Options
     -    Makes the standard input to uux the standard input to
          the command-string.

     -j   Outputs the job identification ASCII string on the
          standard output.  This job identification can be used
          by uustat(1C) to obtain the status of or to terminate a
          job.

     -mfile
          Reports status of the transfer in file. If file is
          omitted, send mail to the requester when the copy is
          completed.

     -n   Sends no notification to user.

     -r   Queues job but does not start the command execution
          process.

   Discussion
     Note that, for security reasons many installations limit the
     list of commands executable on behalf of an incoming request
     from uux.  Many sites permit little more than the receipt of
     mail (see mail(1)) via uux.

     The command-string is made up of one or more arguments that
     look like a shell command line, except that the command
     names and file names may be prefixed by system-name!.  A
     null system-name is interpreted as the local system.

     File names can be one of the following:

     + A full path name

     + A path name preceded by ~xxx where xxx is a login name on
       the specified system and is replaced by that user's login
       directory

     + Prefixed by the current directory

     Any special shell characters (such as <, >, ;, or | should
     be quoted either by quoting the entire command-string or by
     quoting the special characters as individual arguments.

     The uux command attempts to get all files to the execution
     system.  For output files, the file name must be escaped
     using parentheses.

     The command notifies you if the requested command on the
     remote system is disallowed.  The response comes by remote
     mail from the remote machine.

EXAMPLE
     In the following example, uux gets the f1 files from the
     machines named usg and pwba, executes a diff command, and
     puts the results in f1.diff in the local directory:

          uux "!diff usg!/usr/dan/f1 pwba!/a4/dan/f1 > !f1.diff"

     In the next example, the command sends a uucp command to
     system "a" to get /usr/file from system "b" and send it to
     system "c":

          uux a!uucp b!/usr/file \(c!/usr/file\)

PROMPTS
   Command string:
     Enter a command string. A command string is one or more
     arguments that look similar to a shell command line except
     that command names and file names can be prefixed by the
     system name followed by an exclamation point.

   Status File Name:
     Optional. Enter the name of the file to receive status
     reports of the transfer process.

   Stnd Input to UUX is Stnd Input to Cmd:
     Initial value is no.  If you enter yes, the standard input
     to uux becomes the standard input to the command-string.

   Suppress Output of Job Number:
     Initial value is no.  If you enter yes, the job number is
     written to standard output.

   Notify sender:
     The initial value is yes.  Enter yes to send mail to the
     requester when the copy is completed.

   Queue Jobs But Don't Start Transfer:
     The initial value is no.  Enter yes to queue the job but not
     to start the command execution process.

     The following line is an example of a command string:

          a!uucp b!/usr/file (c!/usr/file)

     The previous example sends a uucp(1) command to system a to
     get /usr/file from system b; this file is then sent to
     system c.

     Any special shell characters, such as <, >, ;, or |, should
     be quoted either by quoting the entire command string or by
     quoting the special characters as individual arguments.

FILES
     /usr/spool/uucp       Spool directory
     /usr/lib/uucp/*       Other data and programs

SEE ALSO
     uuclean(1M), uucp(1C).

NOTES
     Only the first command of a shell pipeline can have a
     system-name!.  All other commands are executed on the system
     of the first command.

     The shell metacharacter * will probably not do what you want
     it to do.  The shell tokens << and >> are not implemented.
