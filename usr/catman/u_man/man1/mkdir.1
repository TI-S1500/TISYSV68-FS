MKDIR(1M)                                               MKDIR(1M)

NAME
     mkdir - Makes directories

SYNOPSIS
     mkdir [ -m mode ]  [ -p] dirname ...

DESCRIPTION
     mkdir creates the named directories in mode 777 (possibly
     altered by umask (1)).

     Standard entries in a directory (e.g., the files ., for the
     directory itself, and .., for its parent) are made
     automatically.  mkdir cannot create these entries by name.
     Creation of a directory requires write permission in the
     parent directory.

     The owner ID and group ID of the new directories are set to
     the process's real user ID and group ID, respectively.

     Two options apply to mkdir:

     -m   This option allows users to specify the mode to be used
          for new directories.  Choices for modes can be found in
          chmod (1).

     -p   With this option, mkdir creates dirname by creating all
          the non-existing parent directories first.

EXAMPLE
     To create the subdirectory structure a/next/sub, type:

          mkdir -p a/next/sub

SEE ALSO
     intro(2), mkdir(2), rm(1), sh(1), umask(1).

DIAGNOSTICS
     mkdir returns exit code 0 if all directories given in the
     command line were made successfully.  Otherwise, it prints a
     diagnostic and returns nonzero.  An error code is stored in
     errno.
