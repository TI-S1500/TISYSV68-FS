UMASK(1)                                                 UMASK(1)

NAME
     umask - Sets file-creation mode mask

SYNOPSIS
     umask [ooo]

DESCRIPTION
   Purpose
     The user file-creation mode mask is set to the octal digits
     ooo, which refer to read/write/execute permissions for
     owner, group, and others, respectively (see chmod(2) and
     umask(2)).  The value of each specified digit is subtracted
     from the corresponding "digit" specified by the system for
     the creation of a file (see creat(2)).

   Discussion
     If ooo is omitted, the current value of the mask is printed.
     The umask command is recognized and executed by the shell.

EXAMPLE
     The command umask 022 removes group and others write
     permission.  Files normally created with mode 777 become
     mode 755; files created with mode 666 become mode 644.

PROMPTS
   Set or Read Mode (s,r):
     Enter s to set the file creation mode.  Enter r to print the
     current file creation mode.

   Creation Mode (000,777):
     Enter the creation mode to be used when a new file is
     created.

SEE ALSO
     chmod(1), chmod(2), creat(2), sh(1), umask(2).
