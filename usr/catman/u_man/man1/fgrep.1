FGREP(1)                                                 FGREP(1)

NAME
     fgrep - Searches a file for a pattern

SYNOPSIS
     fgrep -bcfilnvx string files

DESCRIPTION
   Purpose
     The fgrep command searches the input files (standard input
     default) for matching lines that contain the fixed string.
     Normally, each line found is copied to the standard output.
     Because the fgrep pattern is a fixed string, the command is
     fast and compact.  The fgrep command cannot find a string in
     an executable file.

   Options
     -b   Each line is preceded by the block number on which it
          was found.  This is sometimes useful in locating disk
          block numbers by context.  A disk block is 1024 bytes.

     -c   Only a count of matching lines is printed.

     -ffile
          The string list is taken from the file.

     -i   Ignore uppercase and lowercase distinction during
          comparisons.

     -l   Only the names of files with matching lines are listed
          (once), separated by newlines.  The -l option is
          meaningless if standard input is specified.

     -n   Each line is preceded by its relative line number in
          the file.

     -v   All lines but those matching are printed.

     -x   (Exact)  Only lines exactly matching the pattern string
          argument are printed.

   Discussion
     In all cases, the file name is output if there is more than
     one input file.  Care should be taken when using the
     characters $, *, [, ^, |, (, ), and \ in string because they
     are also meaningful to the shell.  It is safest to enclose
     the entire string argument in single quotes '...'.

PROMPTS
   Input File Name(s):
     Enter the name of the file to search.

   Output File Name:
     Enter the name of the file to receive the command output.

   Print All But Matching Lines:
     The initial value is no.  Enter yes to print all lines
     except those that match the pattern.

   Print Exact Matching Lines:
     The initial value is no.  Print only those lines that match
     the pattern exactly.

   Count Matching Lines:
     The initial value is no.  Enter yes to print a count of the
     matching lines.

   Ignore Upper/Lower Case:
     The initial value is no.  Enter yes to cause the command to
     ignore case distinction during matching.

   File Names Only:
     The initial value is no.  Enter yes to print only the names
     of the files with matching lines.

   Print File Line Numbers:
     The initial value is no.  Enter yes to print the line
     numbers as well as the lines that match.

   Print Block Numbers:
     The initial value is no.  Enter yes to print the block
     numbers as well as the lines that match.

   Pattern for Search:
     Enter the pattern to match.  The pattern can not begin with
     -.  The expression should not be enclosed in quotes.

   File Containing Pattern:
     Enter the name of a file that contains the pattern to match.

     ed(1), egrep(1), grep(1), sed(1), sh(1).

DIAGNOSTICS
     Exit status is 0 if any matches are found, 1 if none, 2 for
     syntax errors or inaccessible files (even if matches were
     found).

NOTES
     Lines are limited to 256 characters; longer lines are
     truncated.
