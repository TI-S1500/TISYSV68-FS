NCHECK(1M)                                             NCHECK(1M)

NAME
     ncheck - Generates names from inumbers

SYNOPSIS
     ncheck -ais [ filesystem ]

DESCRIPTION
     The ncheck command with no argument generates a path name
     and inumber list of all files on a set of default file
     systems.  Names of directory files are followed by /..

     A file system must be specified as /dev/rdsk/*:*.

     The report is more useful if sorted.

   Options
     -a   Allows printing of the names . and .., which are
          ordinarily suppressed.

     -i numbers
          Reduces the report to only those files whose inumbers
          follow.

     -s   Reduces the report to special files and files with
          set-user-ID mode.  It is intended to discover concealed
          violations of security policy.

FILES
     /etc/checklist        For default file systems
     /etc/mnttab

SEE ALSO
     fsck(1M), sort(1).

DIAGNOSTICS
     When the file system structure is improper, ?? denotes the
     incorrect specification of a parent for a parentless file,
     and a path name beginning with ... denotes a loop.
