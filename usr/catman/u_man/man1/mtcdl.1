MTCDL(1T)                                               MTCDL(1T)

NAME
     mtcdl - Downloads multidrop terminal concentrators

SYNOPSIS
     mtcdl -dpsv

DESCRIPTION
   Function
     The mtcdl command invokes the parent process of the
     multidrop terminal concentrator (MTC) download utility,
     mtcdl.

   Options
     -d   Enables the memory-dump capability in the initial mtcdl
          process. When the initial mtcdl is running, the dump
          capability is disabled to eliminate unnecessary memory
          uploading and save time entering multiuser mode. After
          the initial mtcdl process completes, the dump
          capability is enabled until changed by the mtcdump
          command. If multidrop terminal concentrator memory
          dumps need to be taken during the multiuser start-up,
          edit the /etc/download file and add this option to the
          mtcdl command.

     -p port_num
          This option is only valid when entered in conjunction
          with the -s option.  It starts the mtcdl daemon for the
          specified port (port_num) only.

     -s slot_num
          Starts the mtcdl for the specified slot (slot_num) in
          which a communications carrier board (CCB) with a
          multidrop host adapter (MHA) option card is installed.
          The information of the MTCs associated with the
          indicated CCB slot is reinitialized according to
          /etc/mtctab.  This information is saved in the shared
          memory segment of the mtcdl. One mtcdl daemon is
          started for each MHA option port on the CCB.  Other
          mtcdl daemons for other CCBs on the system, if other
          CCBs exist, are not affected.

     -v   Enables the verbose mode during the mtcdl process.
          Normally, mtcdl runs silently and logs all activities
          to the /usr/adm/comlog/mtcdllog file.  The verbose mode
          directs the messages to the log file and to the system
          console. When the initial mtcdl process completes, the
          verbose mode is turned off.

   Discussion
     The parent mtcdl creates a shared memory segment for MTC
     information, forks a child for each existing CCB option port
     with an MHA board installed, and terminates after all the
     MTCs have been downloaded.  The mtcdl children stay running
     as daemons until the corresponding CCB is re-downloaded or
     panics.  The MTC definition file, /etc/mtctab, contains all
     the information needed by the mtcdl.  The mtcdl logging is
     in /usr/adm/comlog/mtcdllog.  Normally, the mtcdl is invoked
     automatically when the system enters multiuser mode.

DIAGNOSTICS
     The following messages are displayed when mtcdl is started
     and when the download completes:

          Mtcdl is started
          MTC download process completed
