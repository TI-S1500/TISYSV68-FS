CPDIR(1T)                                               CPDIR(1T)

NAME
     CPDIR - Copies complete directories

SYNOPSIS
     CPDIR

DESCRIPTION
   Purpose
     The CPDIR utility copies a source directory to a destination
     directory.

   Discussion
     CPDIR is a TI Business shell script (accessible through the
     menu) that uses the cpio(1) utility to copy a directory to
     another directory.  The source directory must exist and be
     readable.  If the destination directory exists, it must be
     writable.  If the destination directory does not exist, it
     is created.

     All readable files and subdirectories within the source
     directory are copied to the destination directory.  If a
     file already exists in the destination directory with the
     same name as a file in the source directory, the source
     contents overwrites the destination file contents.
     Subdirectories are created as needed in the destination
     directory.

PROMPTS
   Source Directory:
     Enter the full path name of the directory to be copied.

   Destination Directory
     Enter the full path name of the directory to receive the
     copy.  If the directory does not exist, it is created.  If
     the directory already exists, the files and subdirectories
     of the source directory are copied into it.  Existing files
     of the same name are overwritten.  Any unique files in the
     destination directory will remain.

   Full Listing File Name:
     Enter the full path name of the file to contain the printed
     list of files that are copied.  If no pathname is provided
     to this prompt, the printed list of files go to /dev/null.
     Whether or not a pathname is provided to this prompt does
     not affect the printing of error messages.  All error
     messages are printed on the terminal screen.

     cpio(1).

NOTES
     When logged on as root, cpio changes the owner, group, and
     permissions of the destination directory to match the owner,
     group, and permissions of the source directory.
