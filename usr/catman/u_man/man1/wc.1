WC(1)                                                       WC(1)

NAME
     wc - Provides a count of characters, words, and lines

SYNOPSIS
     wc -clw [files]

DESCRIPTION
   Purpose
     The wc command counts characters, words, and lines in the
     named files or in the standard input if no files appear.

     It also keeps a total count for all named files.  A word is
     a maximal string of characters delimited by spaces, tabs, or
     newlines.  An unprintable character also terminates a word.

     When files are specified on the command line, their names
     are printed along with the counts.

   Options
     The default is -clw.

     -c   Reports character count

     -l   Reports line count

     -w   Reports word count

EXAMPLE
     Assume that filea consists of the following lines:

     this is filea
     1
     2 3 4
     5 6
     last line

     The following example:

          wc filea

     results in the following output:

          5   11   36   filea

     where 5 is the number of lines, 11 is the number of words,
     and 38 is the number of characters.

     The next example:

          wc -w filea

     results in the following output:

          11    filea
