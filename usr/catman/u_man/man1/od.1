OD(1)                                                       OD(1)

NAME
     od - Dumps file (octal dump)

SYNOPSIS
     od -bcdosx [file] [[+]offset[ . ][b]]

DESCRIPTION
   Purpose
     The od command dumps file in one or more formats as selected
     by the options.  If options are not specified, -o is
     default.

   Options
     -b    Interprets bytes in octal.

     -c    Interprets bytes in ASCII.  The following non-graphic
           characters appear as C escapes:
           null=\0
           backspace=\b
           form-feed=\f
           newline=\n
           return=\r
           tab=\t
           Other non-graphic characters appear as 3-digit octal
           numbers.

     -d    Interprets words in unsigned decimal.

     -o    Interprets words in octal.

     -s    Interprets 16-bit words in signed decimal.

     -x    Interprets words in hex.

   Arguments
     The file argument specifies which file is to be dumped.  If
     no file argument is specified, the standard input is used.

     The offset argument specifies the offset in the file where
     dumping is to commence.  This argument is normally
     interpreted as octal bytes.  If . is appended, the offset is
     interpreted in decimal.  If b is appended, the offset is
     interpreted in blocks of 1024 bytes.  If the file argument
     is omitted, the offset argument must be preceded by +.

     Dumping continues until the end-of-file marker.

     If two or more adjacent lines are identical, only the first
     is printed.  The others are replaced by the following:

          ``* same *''

EXAMPLE
     The following example dumps file1 with bytes displayed in
     ASCII and words in hex.

          od -cx file1

     The following example displays the contents of file b
     starting two blocks (2048 characters) into the file.

          od -d b 2b

PROMPTS
   Input File Name:
     Enter the name of the file to display.

   Output File Name:
     Response to this prompt is optional.  Enter a file name to
     receive the output of the command.

   Interpret Bytes in Octal:
     Initial value is no.  If you enter yes, bytes are
     interpreted in octal.

   Interpret Bytes in ASCII:
     Initial value is no.  If you enter yes, bytes are
     interpreted in ASCII.

   Interpret Words in Unsigned Decimal:
     Initial value is no.  If you enter yes, the words are
     interpreted in unsigned decimal.

   Interpret Words in Octal:
     Initial value is no.  If you enter yes, the words are
     interpreted in octal.

   Interpret 16-Bit Words/Unsigned Dec.:
     Initial value is no.  If you enter yes, the 16-bit words are
     interpreted in signed decimal.

   Interpret Words in Hexadecimal:
     Initial value is no.  If you enter yes, the words are
     interpreted in hexadecimal.

   Select Offset Options:
     Initial value is no.  If you enter yes, the following
     prompts will appear.

   Offset:
     Enter the offset where the file dumping is to begin.

   Octal or Decimal Bytes (o,d):
     Enter o to interpret the offset in octal. Enter d to
     interpret the offset in decimal.

   Interpret Offset in Blocks:
     Initial value is no.  If you enter yes, the offset is
     interpreted in blocks of 1024 bytes.
