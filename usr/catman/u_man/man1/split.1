SPLIT(1)                                                 SPLIT(1)

NAME
     split - Splits a file into pieces

SYNOPSIS
     split -n [file [name]]

DESCRIPTION
   Purpose
     The split command reads file and writes it in n-line pieces
     onto a set of output files. The default for n is 1000 lines.

   Discussion
     The name of the first output file is name with the
     characters aa appended. Naming continues lexicographically
     up to zz (a maximum of 676 files).  Name cannot be longer
     than 12 characters.  If no output name is given, the name x
     is the default.  If more lines remain in the file after the
     676th file has been written, split aborts.  The output files
     are not removed.

     If no input file is given or if - is given, then the
     standard input is used.  The input file is not changed.

PROMPTS
   Input File Name:
     Enter the name of the file to be split.

   Output File Name:
     Response to this prompt is optional.  Enter a file name to
     receive the output of the command.

   Number of Lines:
     Enter the number of lines for each piece of the input file.
     The default is 1000.

EXAMPLE
     The following example splits a file named test into a series
     of files, each containing 5 lines, whose names begin with
     sort:

          split -5 test sort

     The first file is named sortaa, the second sortab, and so
     on.

     The following example produces file xaa containing lines 1-
     50, xab containing lines 51-100, and so on:

          split -50 test
