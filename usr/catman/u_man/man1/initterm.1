INITTERM(1T)					     INITTERM(1T)

NAME
     initterm - Initializes the terminal driver

SYNOPSIS
     initterm p

DESCRIPTION
   Purpose
     The initterm process initializes the terminal driver with
     the VDT-attached printer parameters specified by the file
     /etc/alpdefs.  See alpdefs(4).

   Discussion
     Usually the initterm process is executed as part of the
     init(1M) process from /etc/download. The following are
     situations where the initialization of the terminal VDT-
     attached printer parameters must be executed by an operator:

     + After the first system definition takes place and before
       the next reboot

     + If VDT-attached printers are added at some later time

     + If the terminal type is changed

     + If a need exists to change the parameters associated with
       a particular terminal

     For terminals that do not support a pacing response as
     described in alpdefs(4), it may be necessary to fine-tune
     the terminal and VDT-attached printer interaction. To do
     this the user should modify the block transmit rate in the
     file /etc/alpdefs. A higher rate means data is sent to the
     printer less frequently and thus the terminal is faster. A
     lower rate means data is sent to the printer more frequently,
     and thus the terminal is less responsive.	After modifying
     the block transmit rate, execute the initterm process.

FILES
     /etc/alpdefs
     /etc/alpcaps

EXAMPLE
     The following example initializes the terminal driver for
     all VDT-attached printers defined to the system.

	  initterm p

DIAGNOSTICS
     Errors on open of device path name are ignored.

     Error on ioctl(2) causes message with errno to be written to
     the operator's terminal.
