UUCPTO(1T)                                             UUCPTO(1T)

NAME
     uucpto - Sends files to a remote system via uucp(1C)

SYNOPSIS
     uucpto srcfile sitename destfile
     uucpto srcfile all destfile
     uucpto sitename

DESCRIPTION
   Purpose
     The uucpto command copies the file named srcfile located on
     the local system to the file, destfile, on the remote
     system.

   Discussion
     Prior to invoking uucp to perform the file transfer, uucpto
     performs preliminary checks to ensure that lock files do not
     currently exist, that the remote system is currently
     defined, and that other checks are valid (such as ensuring
     that the file or directory is valid and readable).  If the
     all parameter is specified instead of a site name, the uucp
     daemon, uucico, is activated to perform all work files
     currently queued for execution.  If only the sitename
     parameter is specified, uucico contacts the system,
     sitename, and performs all work requests queued at the local
     and remote sites concerning the two systems.

FILES
     /usr/spool/uucp
                    Spool directory

     /usr/lib/uucp/*
                    uucp configuration and program files

SEE ALSO
     uucico(1C), uucp(1C), uucpfrom(1T).

DIAGNOSTICS
     Messages are displayed to inform the user that certain lock
     or status files are being removed.  Other messages are
     displayed to inform the user of error or success conditions
     in queueing or activation of the uucp daemon.

NOTES
     If the uucp daemon, uucico, is not currently active when
     uucpto is activated, all lock and status files for the
     device and system being accessed will be removed.  If uucico
     is active, the request will be queued for execution, unless
     only the site name is provided, in which case a message is
     displayed informing the user to try later.

     To verify that the specified files were transferred, inspect
     the uucp log file, /usr/spool/uucp/LOGFILE.
