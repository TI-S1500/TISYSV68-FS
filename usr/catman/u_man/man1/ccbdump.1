     a file

SYNOPSIS
     ccbdump [-c] slot [file]

DESCRIPTION
   Purpose
     The ccbdump command copies the contents of CCB memory to a
     file.

   Options

   Arguments
     slot    The chassis slot number (base 10 zero relative) of
             the CCB to be dumped.

     [file]  The dump file name. If this argument is omitted,
             ccbdump creates a file in the current working

     To dump CCB memory from the CCB in slot 4 to a file named
     /tmp/ccbcrsh, type:

               ccbdump 4 /tmp/ccbcrsh


     To crash the CCB in slot 10 and copy the contents of memory
     to the default file (ccbxdump) in the current working
     directory, type:

               ccbdump -c 10
