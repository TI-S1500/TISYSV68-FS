SHUTDOWN(1M)                                         SHUTDOWN(1M)

NAME
     shutdown - Terminates all processing

SYNOPSIS
     shutdown [-p] [seconds]

DESCRIPTION
   Purpose
     The shutdown command is part of the TI System V operation
     procedures.  Its primary function is to terminate all
     currently running processes in an orderly and cautious
     manner.

   Options
     -p      Specifies powerfail mode. See the UPS section of The
             TI System V Administrator's Guide for more
             information on the powerfail mode of shutdown.

   Arguments
     The optional seconds argument specifies the number of
     seconds (the default is 60 seconds) to wait after the
     command sends a message to all users on the system.  The
     system then terminates 10 seconds after
     shutdown sends a second message to users.

   Discussion
     The procedure is designed to interact with the person who
     invoked shutdown.  The shutdown command might instruct the
     operator to perform specific tasks or to supply certain
     responses before execution can resume.  The program consists
     of the following steps:

     1. All users logged on the system are notified to log off
        the system by a broadcasted message.  The operator can
        provide a message at this time; otherwise, the standard
        file-save message is displayed.  The shutdown command
        then waits either 60 seconds or the number of seconds
        specified on the shutdown command line, then sends a
        second message, waits 10 seconds, and terminates the
        system.

     2. If the operator wishes to run the file-save procedure,
        shutdown unmounts all file systems.

     3. The super blocks for all file systems are updated before
        the system is stopped (see sync(1)).  To ensure file
        system integrity, this update must be completed before
        the system is rebooted.

DIAGNOSTICS
     The most common error message that occurs is Device busy.
     This message appears when a particular file system cannot be
     unmounted.
