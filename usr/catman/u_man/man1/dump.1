DUMP(1)                                                   DUMP(1)

NAME
     dump - Dumps selected parts of an object file

SYNOPSIS
     dump -acfghlorstz files

DESCRIPTION
   Purpose
     The dump command dumps selected parts of each of its object
     file arguments.

     This command accepts both object files and archives of
     object files.  Do not use dump on archives that contain
     files other than object (executable) files.

   Options
     -a   Dumps archive header of each member of the archive.

     -c   Dumps the string table.

     -f   Dumps each file header.

     -g   Dumps global symbols in archive symbol table.

     -h   Dumps section headers.

     -l   Dumps line number information.  Does not work on object
          files created with SVS compilers.

     -o   Dumps each optional header.

     -r   Dumps relocation information.

     -s   Dumps section contents.

     -t   Dumps symbol table entries.

     -z name
          Dumps line number entries for the named function.  Does
          not work on object files created with SVS compilers.

   Modifiers
     The following modifiers are used in conjunction with the
     options listed above to modify their capabilities.

     -d num
          Dumps the section number or range of sections starting
          at the given number and ending either at the last
          section number or the number specified by +d.

     +d num
          Dumps sections in the range either beginning with first
          section or beginning with section specified by -d.

          The +d and -d options work with the -h, -l, -r, and -s
          options.

     -n name
          Dumps information pertaining only to the named entity.
          This modifier applies to options -h, -s, -r, -l, and
          -t.

     -p   Suppresses printing of the headers.

     -t index
          Dumps only the indexed symbol table entry.  When the -t
          is used in conjunction with +t, it specifies a range of
          symbol table entries.

     +t index
          Dumps the symbol table entries in the range ending with
          the indexed entry.  The range begins at the first
          symbol table entry or at the entry specified by the -t
          option.

     -u   Underlines the name of the file for emphasis.  Do not
          use this modifier when dumping to a VDT.

     -v   Dumps information in symbolic representation rather
          than numeric (e.g., C_STATIC instead of 0X02).  This
          modifier can be used with all the above options except
          -s, -o, and -z.

     -z name,num
          Dumps line number entry or range of line numbers
          starting at the given number for the named function.
          Does not work on object files created with SVS
          compilers.

     +z num
          Dumps line numbers starting at either function name or
          number specified by -z, up to the number specified by
          +z.  Does not work on object files created with SVS
          compilers.

   Discussion
     Blanks separating an option and its modifier are optional.
     The comma separating the name from the number modifying the
     -z option may be replaced by a blank.

     The dump command attempts to format the information it dumps
     in a meaningful way, printing certain information in
     character, hex, octal, or decimal representation, as
     appropriate.

EXAMPLES
     The following example prints section headers of the object
     file named a to standard output.

          dump -h a

     The following command prints to standard output the section
     headers of file a for sections 2 and 3.

          dump -h -d2 +d3 a

     The following command prints to standard output the indexed
     symbol table entries from 200 to 220.

          dump -t200 +t220 a
