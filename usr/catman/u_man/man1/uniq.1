UNIQ(1) 						  UNIQ(1)

NAME
     uniq - Reports repeated lines in a file

SYNOPSIS
     uniq -cdu +n -n [input[output]]

DESCRIPTION
   Purpose
     The uniq command reads the input file and compares adjacent
     lines.  Normally, the second and succeeding copies of
     repeated lines are removed from the command output.  The
     first copy of repeated lines is written to the output file.
     The input and output should always be different; otherwise,
     a zero-length file is created.  If input is omitted,
     standard input is used.  If output is omitted, standard
     output is used.

     Note that repeated lines must be adjacent in order to be
     found.  See sort(1).

     Each line must be less than 1024 characters long.

     Only one of the options c, d, or u can be used in the
     command. The default, if no options are specified, is a
     combination of the -d and -u options.

   Options
     -c   Overrides -u and -d, generating an output report in
	  default style but with each line preceded by a count of
	  the number of times it occurred.

     -d   Outputs only the repeated lines.  The default if no
	  options are specified is the output of the -u and -d
	  options.

     -u   Outputs only the lines that are not repeated in the
	  original file.

     The + and - options specify skipping an initial portion of
     each line in the comparison:

     -n   The first n fields, together with any blanks before
	  each, are ignored.  A field is defined as a string of
	  nonspace, nontab characters separated by tabs and
	  spaces from its neighbors.

     +n   The first n characters are ignored.  Fields are skipped
	  before characters.

EXAMPLE
     Assume that filea contains the following lines:

	  Line 1
	  Line 1
	  Line 11
	  Line 2
	  Line 3
	  Line 3

     The following command:

	  uniq filea

     results in the following output:

	  Line 1
	  Line 11
	  Line 2
	  Line 3

     Assume that file xx contains the following lines:

	  this is a line
	  This is a line
	  THis is a line

     The following three examples show usage of the +n and -n
     options with their command outputs.

	  Command	       Output

	  uniq -1 xx	       this is a line

	  uniq +1 xx	       this is a line
			     This is a line

	  uniq +2 xx	       this is a line

PROMPTS
   Input File Name:
     Enter the name of the file process.

   Output File Name:
     Response to this prompt is optional.  Enter a file name to
     receive the output of the command.

   Number of Fields to Skip:
     Optional. Enter the number of fields to ignore.

   Number of Characters to Skip:
     Optional. Enter the number of characters to ignore.

   Report Only Non-Repeated Lines:
     Initial value is no. If yes is entered only the lines that
     are not repeated in the original file are reported.

   Report Only Repeated Lines:
     Initial value is no.  If you enter yes, only one copy of the
     repeated lines is reported.

   Count of Each Line Occurrence:
     Initial value is no.  If you enter yes, each line in the
     output file is preceded by a count of the number of times it
     occurred.
