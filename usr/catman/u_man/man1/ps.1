NAME
     ps - Reports process status

SYNOPSIS
     ps -adefglnptu

DESCRIPTION
   Purpose
     The ps command prints information about active processes by
     accessing the executing kernel directly.

   Options
     Without options, information is printed about processes
     associated with the current terminal.  Otherwise, the
     displayed information is controlled by the following
     options:

     -a 	 Prints information about all processes except
		 process group leaders and processes not
		 associated with a terminal.

     -d 	 Prints information about all processes except
		 process group leaders.

     -e 	 Prints information about all processes.

     -f 	 Generates a full listing.  Normally, a short
		 listing containing only process ID, terminal
		 (tty) identifier, cumulative execution time, and
		 the command name is printed.

     -g glist	 Restricts listing to data about processes whose
		 process groups are given in glist, where glist
		 is a list of the PIDs of the process group
		 leaders and is in the same format as tlist.

     -l 	 Generates a long listing.

     -n namelist
		 Specifies an alternate system namelist file. The
		 default file is /unix.

     -p plist	 Restricts listing to data about processes whose
		 process ID numbers are given in plist, where
		 plist is in the same format as tlist.

     -t tlist	 Restricts listing to data about the processes
		 associated with the terminals given in tlist,
		 where tlist can be in one of two forms: a list
		 of terminal identifiers separated by commas, or
		 a list of terminal identifiers enclosed in
		 double quotes and separated by a comma and/or
		 one or more spaces.

     -u ulist	 Restricts listing to data about processes whose
		 user ID numbers or login names are given in
		 ulist, where ulist is in the same format as
		 tlist.  In the listing, the numerical user ID is
		 printed unless the -f option is used, in which
		 case the login name is printed.

   Command Output
     The column headings and the meaning of the columns in a ps
     listing are given below. The labels (f) and (l) indicate the
     option (full or long) that causes the corresponding heading
     to appear.  The label (all) means that the heading always
     appears.  Note that the options -f and -l only determine
     what information is provided for a process. They do not
     determine which processes are to be listed.  The labels on
     the left side of the following list are the column headings
     in the ps output.

     F	   (l)	     Flags (hex and additive) associated with the
		     process:
		     01    In core
		     02    System process
		     04    Locked in core (e.g., for physical
			     I/O)
		     08    Being swapped
		     10    Being traced
		     20    Another tracing flag
		     40    Text pointer valid
		     80    Process is partially swapped
		     100   Sharing data/ustack due to fork
		     200   Doing raw I/O to locked pages
		     800   Doing an exit
		     1000  Trying to expand
		     2000  Requires SKY context save
		     4000  Should have itself swapped
		     8000  Swapper should swap out this process

     S	   (l)	     The state of the process.	In the following
		     list, x is a number indicating the processor
		     where the process is executing.  Processors
		     are numbered beginning with 0.
		     0	   Non-existent
		     Sx    Sleeping
		     Wx    Waiting
		     Rx    Running
		     Ix    Intermediate
		     Zx    Terminated
		     Tx    Stopped
		     Xx    Growing
		     Hx    Halted by operator control utility

     UID   (f,l)     The user ID number of the process owner; the
		     login name is printed under the -f option.

     PID   (all)     The process ID of the process. It is
		     possible to kill a process if you know the
		     PID.

     PPID  (f,l)     The process ID of the parent process.

     C	   (f,l)     Processor utilization for scheduling.

     STIME (f)	     Starting time of the process.

     PRI   (l)	     The priority of the process. Higher numbers
		     mean lower priority.

     NI    (l)	     Nice value. Used in priority computation.

     RSSZ  (l)	     The number of data and stack pages currently
		     in core.

     SZ    (l)	     The number of pages in the process's data
		     and stack segments.

     WCHAN (l)	     The event for which the process is waiting
		     or sleeping.  If blank, the process is
		     running.

     TTY   (all)     The controlling terminal for the process.

     TIME  (all)     The cumulative execution time for the
		     process.

     COMD  (all)     The command name.

     A process that has exited and has a parent but has not yet
     been killed by the parent is marked <defunct>.  This does
     not indicate a problem unless the defunct process is still
     displayed when you invoke ps again immediately.

     Under the -f option, ps tries to determine the command name
     and arguments given when the process was created by
     examining memory or the swap area. Failing this, the command
     name, as it would appear without the -f option, is printed.

EXAMPLE
     The ps -f -u "root,lp,rwr" command line produces output
     similar to the following:

NOTES
     Things can change while ps is running. The picture ps gives
     is only a close approximation to reality.	Some data printed
     for defunct processes are irrelevant.

     It is remotely possible for ps to use old information in the
     file /etc/ps_data.  The command will update ps_data when it
     detects that the /dev directory or /etc/passwd file has been
     modified.	The modify time of /dev will not change, however,
     if, for instance, terminal names are changed because nothing
     was added or deleted from /dev.  If ps ever displays suspect
     information, the removal of ps_data will cause device and
     user data to be updated.
