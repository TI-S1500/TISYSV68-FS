NAME
     cdc - Changes the delta commentary of an SCCS delta

SYNOPSIS
     cdc -mry files

DESCRIPTION
   Purpose
     The cdc command changes the delta commentary for the SID
     specified by the -r option of each named SCCS file.

   Discussion
     Delta commentary is defined to be the Modification Request
     (MR) and comment information normally specified via the
     delta(1) command (-m and -y options).

     If a directory is named, cdc behaves as though each file in
     the directory were specified as a named file, except that
     non-SCCS files (last component of the path name does not
     begin with s.)  and unreadable files are silently ignored.
     If a name of - is given, the standard input is read (see
     NOTES).  Each line of the standard input is taken to be the
     name of an SCCS file to be processed.

     The exact permissions necessary to modify the SCCS file are
     documented in the ``Source Code Control System'' in the
     TI System V User's Guide.  There are two permission conditions.
     If you made the delta, you can change its delta commentary.
     If you own the file and directory, you can modify the delta
     commentary. The v flag must be set (see admin(1)) in order to
     modify delta commentary.

   Options
     Options to cdc may appear in any order.  All the described
     options apply independently to each named file.

     -rSID
	  Specifies the SCCS IDentification (SID) string of a
	  delta for which the delta commentary is to be changed.

     -mmrlist
	  The value for this option is a list of MR numbers.  If
	  the SCCS file has the v flag set (see admin(1)), then a
	  list of MR numbers to be added and/or deleted in the
	  delta commentary of the SID specified by the -r keyletter
	  may be supplied.  A null MR list has no effect.

	  MR entries are added to the list of MRs in the same
	  manner as that of delta(1).  In order to delete an MR,
	  precede the MR number with the character ! (see
	  EXAMPLES).  If the MR to be deleted is currently in the
	  list of MRs, it is removed and changed into a "comment"
	  line.  A list of all deleted MRs is placed in the
	  comment section of the delta commentary and preceded by
	  a comment line stating that they were deleted.

	  If -m is not used and the standard input is a terminal,
	  the prompt MRs? is issued on the standard output before
	  the standard input is read; if the standard input is
	  not a terminal, no prompt is issued.	The MRs? prompt
	  always precedes the comments? prompt (see -y
	  keyletter).

	  MRs in a list are separated by blanks and/or tab
	  characters.  An unescaped newline character terminates
	  the MR list.

	  Note that if the v flag has a value (see admin(1)), it
	  is taken to be the name of a program (or shell
	  procedure) that validates the correctness of the MR
	  numbers.  If a non-zero exit status is returned from
	  the MR number validation program, cdc terminates and
	  the delta commentary remains unchanged.

     -ycomment
	  The value for this argument is arbitrary text that is
	  used to replace the comment(s) already existing for the
	  delta specified by the -r option.  The previous comments
	  are kept and preceded by a comment line stating that they
	  were changed.  A null comment has no effect.

	  If -y is not specified and the standard input is a
	  terminal, the prompt comments? is issued on the
	  standard output before the standard input is read; if
	  the standard input is not a terminal, no prompt is
	  issued.  An unescaped newline character terminates the
	  comment text.

EXAMPLES
       cdc -r1.6 -m"bl78-12345 !bl77-54321 bl79-00001" -ytrouble s.file

     The previous example adds bl78-12345 and bl79-00001 to the
     MR list, removes bl77-54321 from the MR list, and adds the
     comment ``trouble'' to delta 1.6 of s.file.  The following
     example performs the same functions:

	  cdc -r1.6 s.file
	  MRs? !bl77-54321 bl78-12345 bl79-00001
	  comments? trouble

NOTES
     If SCCS file names are supplied to the cdc command via the
     standard input (- on the command line), then the -m and -y
     options must also be used.
