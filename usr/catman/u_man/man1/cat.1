CAT(1)                                                     CAT(1)

NAME
     cat - Concatenates and prints files

SYNOPSIS
     cat -bestuv files

DESCRIPTION
   Purpose
     The cat command reads each file in sequence and writes it on
     the standard output.

   Options
     -b   Forces conversion of unprintable characters to a |.
          Use this option if the output is going to the terminal.

     -e   When used with -v, causes a $ to be printed after the
          last character of a line.

     -s   Makes cat silent about non-existent files.

     -t   When used with -v, causes a tab to be printed as a ^I.

     -u   Output is buffered unless the -u option is specified.

     -v   Makes the following unprintable characters visible:

          +  Control characters are printed as ^X.

          +  The DEL character (octal 0177) is printed as ^?.

          +  Non-ASCII characters (with the high-order bit set)
             are printed as M-x, where x is the character
             specified by the seven low-order bits.

   Discussion
     If no input file is given, or if the argument - is
     encountered, cat reads from the standard input.

     The output file cannot have the same name as an input file
     unless the input file is a special file.

     If cat is invoked without the -v option and the argument to
     cat is a file containing unprintable characters (such as an
     executable command file), a | is substituted for the
     unprintable character.

EXAMPLES
     The following example prints file1 to the terminal screen.

          cat file1

     The following example concatenates file1 and file2.  The
     output is redirected with > to file3.

          cat file1 file2 >file3

PROMPTS
   File Name(s):
     The name of the files to be processed.  If the files are to
     be sent somewhere other than to the screen (standard
     output), these are the source files.

   Output File Name:
     If you do not respond to this prompt, the file specified in
     the previous prompt is displayed.  If you respond to this
     prompt, the following additional prompt is displayed:

   Replace or Append:
     Respond to this prompt to specify the operation on the file
     specified with the Output File Name: prompt.  Respond R or r
     to replace the destination file with the source file.
     Respond A or a to append the destination file with the
     source file.

SEE ALSO
     cp(1), more(1), pg(1), pr(1), show(1T).

NOTES
     Command formats such as the following cause the original
     data in file1 to be lost:

          cat file1 file2 >file1

     To append file2 to file1, specify the following:

          cat file2 >>file1
