NAME
     chrtbl - Generates character classification and conversion
     tables

SYNOPSIS
     chrtbl [file]

DESCRIPTION
     The chrtbl command creates a character classification table
     and an uppercase/lowercase conversion table.  The tables are
     contained in a byte-sized array encoded such that a table
     lookup can be used to determine the character classification
     of a character or to convert a character (see ctype(3C)).
     The size of the array is 257*2 bytes:  257 bytes are
     required for the 8-bit code set character classification
     table and 257 bytes for the uppercase to lowercase and
     lowercase to uppercase conversion table.

     chrtbl reads the user-defined character classification and
     conversion information from file and creates two output
     files in the current directory.  One output file, ctype.c (a
     C-language source file), contains the 257*2-byte array
     generated from processing the information from file.  You
     should review the content of ctype.c to verify that the
     array is set up as you had planned. (In addition, an
     application program could use ctype.c .)  The first 257
     bytes of the array in ctype.c are used for character
     classification.  The characters used for initializing these
     bytes of the array represent character classifications that
     are defined in /usr/include/ctype.h ; for example, _L means
     a character is lowercase and _S|_B means the character is
     both a spacing character and a blank.  The last 257 bytes of
     the array are used for character conversion.  These bytes of
     the array are initialized so that characters for which you
     do not provide conversion information will be converted to
     themselves.  When you do provide conversion information, the
     first value of the pair is stored where the second one would
     be stored normally, and vice versa; for example, if you
     provide <0x41 0x61>, 0x61 is stored where 0x41 would be
     stored normally, and 0x61 is stored where 0x41 would be
     stored normally.

     The second output file (a data file) contains the same
     information, but is structured for efficient use by the
     character classification and conversion routines (see
     ctype(3C)).  The name of this output file is the value of
     the character classification chrclass read in from file.
     This output file must be installed in the /lib/chrclass
     directory under this name by someone who is super-user or a
     member of group bin.  This file must be readable by user,
     group, and other; no other permissions should be set.  To
     use the character classification and conversion tables on
     this file, set the environmental variable CHRCLASS (see
     environ(5)) to the name of this file and export the
     variable; for example, if the name of this file (and
     character class) is xyz, you should issue the commands:
     CHRCLASS=xyz ; export CHRCLASS .

     If no input file is given, or if the argument - is
     encountered, chrtbl reads from the standard input file.

     The syntax of file allows the user to define the name of the
     data file created by chrtbl, the assignment of characters to
     character classifications and the relationship between
     uppercase and lowercase letters.  The character
     classifications recognized by chrtbl are:

	  chrclass    Name of the data file to be created by
		      chrtbl

	  isupper     Character codes to be classified as
		      uppercase letters

	  islower     Character codes to be classified as
		      lowercase letters

	  isdigit     Character codes to be classified as numeric

	  isspace     Character codes to be classified as a
		      spacing (delimiter) character

	  ispunct     Character codes to be classified as a
		      punctuation character

	  iscntrl     Character codes to be classified as a
		      control character

	  isblank     Character code for the space character

	  isxdigit    Character codes to be classified as
		      hexadecimal digits

	  ul	      Relationship between uppercase and
		      lowercase characters

     Any lines with the number sign (#) in the first column are
     treated as comments and are ignored.  Blank lines are also
     ignored.

     A character can be represented as a hexadecimal or octal
     constant (for example, the letter a can be represented as
     0x61 in hexadecimal or 0141 in octal).  Hexadecimal and
     octal constants can be separated by one or more space and
     tab characters.

     The dash character (-) can be used to indicate a range of
     consecutive numbers.  Zero or more space characters can be
     used for separating the dash character from the numbers.

     The backslash character (\) is used for line continuation.
     Only a carriage return is permitted after the backslash
     character.

     The relationship between uppercase and lowercase letters
     (ul) is expressed as ordered pairs of octal or hexadecimal
     constants:  <uppercase_character lowercase_character>.
     These two constants can be separated by one or more space
     characters.  Zero or more space characters can be used for
     separating the angle brackets (< >) from the numbers.

EXAMPLE
     The following is an example of an input file used to create
     the ASCII code set definition table on a file named ascii.
	  chrclass  ascii
	  isupper   0x41 - 0x5a
	  islower   0x61 - 0x7a
	  isdigit   0x30 - 0x39
	  isspace   0x20 0x9 - 0xd
	  ispunct   0x21 - 0x2f    0x3a - 0x40	  \
		    0x5b - 0x60    0x7b - 0x7e
	  iscntrl   0x0 - 0x1f	   0x7f
	  isblank   0x20
	  isxdigit  0x30 - 0x39    0x61 - 0x66	  \
		   0x41 - 0x46
	  ul	   <0x41 0x61> <0x42 0x62> <0x43 0x63>	\
		   <0x44 0x64> <0x45 0x65> <0x46 0x66>	\
		   <0x47 0x67> <0x48 0x68> <0x49 0x69>	\
		   <0x4a 0x6a> <0x4b 0x6b> <0x4c 0x6c>	\
		   <0x4d 0x6d> <0x4e 0x6e> <0x4f 0x6f>	\

DIAGNOSTICS
     The error messages produced by chrtbl are intended to be
     self-explanatory.	They indicate errors in the command line
     or syntactic errors encountered within the input file.
