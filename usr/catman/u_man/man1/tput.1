TPUT(1) 						  TPUT(1)

NAME
     tput - Initializes a terminal or queries the terminfo
     database

SYNOPSIS
     tput -S
     tput -T capname
     tput init
     tput reset
     tput longname

DESCRIPTION
   Purpose
     The tput command uses the terminfo(4) database to make
     terminal-dependent capabilities and information available to
     the shell.

     The command outputs a string if the attribute capability
     name (capname) is of type string or outputs an integer if
     the attribute is of type integer.	If the attribute is of
     type Boolean, tput simply sets the exit code (0 for TRUE, 1
     for FALSE) and returns no output.

     -S        Allows more than one capability per invocation of
	       tput.  The capabilities must be passed to tput
	       from the standard input instead of from the
	       command line (see example).  Only one  capname is
	       allowed per line.  The -S option changes the
	       meaning of the 0 and 1 Boolean and string exit
	       codes (see EXIT CODES).

     -Ttype    Indicates the type of terminal.	Normally this
	       flag is unnecessary, because the default is taken
	       from the environment variable TERM.

     capname   Indicates the attribute from the terminfo
	       database.  See terminfo(4).

     init      Initiates the following if the terminfo database
	       is present and an entry for the user's terminal
	       exists (see -Ttype, above):

	       1. If present, the terminal's initialization
		  strings will be output (is1, is2, is3, if,
		  iprog)

	       2. Any delays (e.g., newline) specified in the
		  entry will be set in the tty driver

	       3. Tabs expansion will be turned on or off
		  according to the specification in the entry

	       4. If tabs are not expanded, standard tabs will be
		  set (every 8 spaces).

	       If an entry does not contain the information
	       needed for any of the four above activities, that
	       activity will be skipped silently.

     reset     Outputs the terminal's reset strings (rs1, rs3,
	       rf), if present, instead of putting out
	       initialization strings. If the reset strings are
	       not present but initialization strings are, the
	       initialization strings will be output. Otherwise,
	       reset acts identically to init.

     longname  Outputs the long name of the terminal if the
	       terminfo database is present and an entry for the
	       user's terminal exists (see -Ttype above). The
	       longname is the last name in the first line of the
	       terminal's description in the terminfo database.
	       See term(5).

EXAMPLES
     tput clear        Echoes clear-screen sequence for the
		       current terminal.

     tput cols	       Prints number of columns for the current
		       terminal.

     bold=`tput smso`  Sets shell variable bold to stand-out mode
		       sequence for current terminal.  This might
		       be followed by a prompt:

		       echo "${bold}Please type in your name: \c"

     tput init	       Initializes the terminal according to the
		       type of terminal in the environmental
		       variable TERM. This command should be
		       included in everyone's .profile after the
		       environmental variable TERM has been
		       exported, as illustrated on the profile(4)
		       manual page.

     tput -Tt9 reset   Resets a Texas Instruments 931 terminal,
		       overriding the type of terminal in the
		       environmental variable TERM.

     tput cup 23 4     Sends the sequence to move the cursor to
		       row 23, column 4.

     tput longname     Prints the long name from the terminfo
		       database for the type of terminal
		       specified in the environmental variable
		       TERM.

PROMPTS
   Reset:
     Initial value is no.  If you enter yes, your terminal will
     be reset to its original attributes.

   Blink:
     Initial value is no.  If you enter yes, the current input
     line will blink.

   Bold:
     Initial value is no.  If you enter yes, the current input
     line will be in bold print.

   Clear Screen:
     Initial value is no.  If yes is entered the screen will be
     cleared.

   Print Number of Columns:
     Initial value is no.  If you enter yes, the number of
     columns for your terminal type will be printed.

   Reverse Video:
     Initial value is no.  If you enter yes, the current input
     line will be in reversed video.

   Underline On:
     Initial value is no.  If you enter yes, the current input
     line will be underlined.

   Underline Off:
     Initial value is no.  If you enter yes, the current input
     line will not be underlined.

FILES
     /usr/lib/terminfo/?/*    Terminal descriptor files
     /usr/include/term.h      Definition files
     /usr/include/curses.h    curses(3X) header file
     /usr/lib/tabset/*	      Tab settings for some terminals, in
			      a format appropriate to be output
			      to the terminal (escape sequences
			      that set margins and tabs).

SEE ALSO
     stty(1), terminfo(4).

   Exit Codes
     The tput command prints error messages and returns the
     following exit codes on error (Note that the following are
     not the printed error messages but an explanation of the
     printed error messages):

     -1 	    Usage error.

     -2 	    Bad terminal type.

     -3 	    Bad capname.

     In addition, -1 is printed if a capname is requested for a
     terminal that has no value for that capname.

   Diagnostics
     Usage: tput [-T term] capname [tparm argument...]
	  Indicates an invalid argument on the command line.

     Unknown terminfo capability xxx
	  Indicates xxx is not a valid attribute found in the
	  terminfo database.

     Unknown terminal "xxx"
	  Indicates that xxx is a terminal type not found in
	  the terminfo database.
