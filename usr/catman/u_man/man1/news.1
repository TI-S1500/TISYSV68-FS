NEWS(1)                                                   NEWS(1)

NAME
     news - Prints news items

SYNOPSIS
     news -ans [ items ]

DESCRIPTION
   Purpose
     The news command is used by the system administrator to keep
     the user informed of current events.  By convention, these
     events are described by files in the directory /usr/news.

   Options
     -a   Causes news to print all items, regardless of currency.
          In this case, the stored time is not changed.


     -n   Causes news to report the names of the current items
          without printing their contents and without changing
          the stored time.


     -s   Causes news to report how many current items exist
          without printing their names or contents and without
          changing the stored time.  It is useful to include such
          an invocation of news in one's .profile file or in the
          system's /etc/profile.

   Arguments
     The items are specific news items that are to be printed.

     If a delete is typed during the printing of a news item,
     printing stops and the next item is started.  Another delete
     within one second of the first causes the program to
     terminate.

   Discussion
     When invoked without arguments, news prints the contents of
     all current files in /usr/news, most recent first, with each
     preceded by an appropriate header.  The news command stores
     the currency time as the modification date of a file named
     .news_time in the user's home directory (the identity of
     this directory is determined by the environment variable
     $HOME); only files more recent than this currency time are
     considered current.

EXAMPLE
     The following command prints system news, if any exists in
     the directory /usr/news.

          news -a

PROMPTS
   Print All Items:
     The initial value is no.  Enter yes to print all news items,
     regardless of currency.

FILES
     /etc/profile
     /usr/news/*
     $HOME/.news_time
