FINC(1M)                                                 FINC(1M)

NAME
     finc - Provides a fast incremental backup

SYNOPSIS
     finc -acmn file-system raw-tape

DESCRIPTION
   Purpose
     The finc command selectively copies the input file-system to
     the output raw-tape. The utility runs faster on block than
     character devices.

   Options
     The argument n in the options that follow is an optionally
     signed decimal integer, where +n means more than n, -n means
     less than n, and n means exactly n.  A day is defined as a
     24-hour period.

     -a n  Copies files accessed in n days.

     -c n  Copies inodes changed in n days.

     -m n  Copies files modified in n days.

     -n file
           Copies any file modified more recently than the
           argument file.

   Discussion
     Mount the input file-system in read-only mode to ensure an
     accurate backup.  Acceptable results can also be obtained in
     read-write mode.  The tape must be previously labelled by
     labelit, as explained in volcopy(1M).  The selection is
     controlled by the options, accepting only those inodes/files
     for whom the conditions are true.

     It is recommended that production of a finc tape be preceded
     by the ff(1) command. The output of ff can then be saved as
     an index of the tape's contents.  Files on a finc tape can
     be recovered with the frec command.

EXAMPLES
     The following command writes a tape consisting of all files
     from file-system /usr modified in the last 48 hours:

          finc -m -2 /dev/rdsk/sys:usr /dev/rqt/0h

PROMPTS
   Input File System:
     Enter the name of the file system to copy.

   Raw Tape Output:
     Enter the name of the raw tape device to receive the output.

   Accessed in (+,-) days:
     Response to this prompt is optional.  Enter the number of
     days.  The command copies files that were accessed in the
     specified number of days.

   Modified in (+,-) days:
     Response to this prompt is optional.  Enter the number of
     days.  The command copies files that were modified in the
     specified number of days.

   Changed in (+,-) days:
     Response to this prompt is optional.  Enter the number of
     days.  The command copies inodes that were changed in the
     specified number of days.

   Comparison File Name:
     Response to this prompt is optional.  Enter the name of a
     file.  The command copies files that were modified more
     recently than the named file.
