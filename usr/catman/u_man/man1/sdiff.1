SDIFF(1)						 SDIFF(1)

NAME
     sdiff - Compares files side-by-side

SYNOPSIS
     sdiff -losw file1 file2

DESCRIPTION
   Purpose
     The sdiff command uses the output of diff(1) to produce a
     side-by-side listing of two files indicating those lines
     that are different.

   Discussion
     Corresponding lines of the two files named in this command
     are printed with a gutter (column) between them.  If the
     gutter is empty, the lines are identical. A < in the gutter
     indicates the line exists only in file1.  A > in the gutter
     indicates the line exists only in file2.  A | indicates
     lines that are different.

   Options
     -l     Prints only the left side of any lines that are
	    identical.

     -o  output
	    Uses the next argument, output, as the name of a
	    third file that is created as a user-controlled
	    merging of file1 and file2.  Identical lines of file1
	    and file2 are copied to output.  Sets of differences,
	    as produced by diff(1), are printed; where a set of
	    differences share a common gutter character.  After
	    printing each set of differences, sdiff prompts the
	    user with a % and waits a user-typed command.  If
	    sdiff encounters consecutive sets of differences, it
	    prompts the user for a user-typed command after the
	    last set of differences and performs the selected
	    operation on all of the consecutive differences.  The
	    following are the user-typed commands:

	    l	  Appends the left column to the output file.

	    r	  Appends the right column to the output file.

	    s	  Turns on silent mode so that identical lines
		  are not printed.  Also produces a script not
		  usable by ed.  After this command, sdiff waits
		  for one of the other commands to indicate what
		  should be done with the differences it prints.

	    v	  Turns off silent mode.  After this command,
		  sdiff is still waiting for one of the other
		  commands to indicate what should be done with
		  the differences it prints.

	    e  l  Calls the ed editor with the left column.

	    e  r  Calls the ed editor with the right column.

	    e  b  Calls the ed editor with the concatenation of
		  left and right.

	    e	  Calls the ed editor with a zero-length file.

	    q	  Exits from the program.

		  On exit from the editor, the changes are
		  incorporated into the output file.

     -s     Does not print identical lines.  Also produces script
	    not usable by ed.

     -w n   Uses the next argument, n, as the width of the output
	    line.  The default line length is 80 characters.  The
	    minimum length is 20; the maximum is 200.  If n
	    violates these limits, it is silently changed to the
	    limit.

PROMPTS
   File 1:
     Enter the name of a file to compare.

   File 2:
     Enter the name of a file to compare to file 1.

   File Name to Merge Identical Lines:
     Enter a file name to receive the output of as a result of
     merging file 1 and file 2.

   Print Left Side of Identical Lines:
     Initial value is no.  If you enter yes, only the left side
     of any identical lines are printed.

   Print Identical Lines:
     Initial value is yes.  If you enter no, identical lines are
     not printed.

   Output Line Width(20-200):
     Enter the width of the output line.  The default width is 80
     characters.

EXAMPLE
     Assume that the two files named test1 and test2 exist in
     your current directory with the following contents:

     test1:		 test2:

     Test 1 results	 Test 2 results
     red		 red
     orange		 Orange
     yellow		 yellow
     green		 green
     blue		 blue
     indigo		 violet
     violet		 black

     Enter the following command to produce a side-by-side
     listing of file differences with 60-column output:

	  sdiff -w60 test1 test2

     The output is as follows:

	  Test 1 results |    Test 2 results
	  red		      red
	  orange	 |    Orange
	  yellow	      yellow
	  green 	      green
	  blue		      blue
	  indigo	 <
	  violet	      violet
			 >    black

     Note that -w156 prints the two corresponding lines one above
     the other with the indicator at the right margin.	This
     format makes the differences easy for the user to find.

SEE ALSO
     diff(1), ed(1).

NOTE
     Since file 2 will be printed on the right side of the
     output, the tab positions may be different. Columns that are
     positioned with tabs may not line up with columns that are
     positioned with spaces.
