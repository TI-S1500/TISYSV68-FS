NAME
     pm - Invokes TI System V Performance Monitor

SYNOPSIS
     pm -f[-u]
     pm -b[-0...9A...FaegiLlMnprstuvw]
     pm -h[-0...9A...FaegiLnpRstuvw]
     pm -k
     pm -x[-Lu]

DESCRIPTION
     The TI System V Performance Monitor (pm) is a data gathering
     and system measurement tool for performance tuning your
     system.  In foreground mode, pm graphically displays
     information on the system configuration, peripheral devices,
     processor utilization, and operating system functions and
     data structures. In background mode, pm collects user-
     selectable system metrics at a specified sample rate and
     saves them in a LOG file. At a later time, pm can be
     initiated to either examine the collected system metrics
     interactively or generate hardcopy reports and summaries.

     The pm command is terminal-independent; no escape codes or
     hardware characteristics are assumed. All knowledge of the
     terminal environment is acquired at run time from a terminal
     data base indexed by the TERM environmental symbol. This
     database is created and maintained by tde(1T), the terminal
     definition editor.

   Options
     -0...9A...F	 Includes statistics for processor board
			 in slot.

     -a 		 Includes statistics for all options.

     -b 		 Collects statistics in background, and
			 sends to LOG file.

     -eMMddhhmmYY	 Sets end date in date(1) format of
			 collection process.

     -f 		 Collects statistics in foreground, and
			 displays on terminal.

     -g 		 Includes statistics for general
			 information.

     -h 		 Generates history report from LOG file.

     -i 		 Includes statistics for BusNet I/O
			 activity.

     -k 		 Kills pm background process.

     -Lfile		 Uses file instead of /usr/adm/sa/pm_log.

     -lpid		 Includes statistics for linear process
			 space for pid, where pid is the process
			 ID.

     -MuserID		 Sends mail to userID if error occurs
			 during background execution.

     -mx		 Includes statistics for physical memory
			 map for CPU in slot x, where x is the
			 slot number.

     -nx		 Includes statistics for network activity
			 for CCB in slot x, where x is the slot
			 number.

     -p 		 Includes statistics for configurable
			 parameters.

     -Rfile		 Sends history report to file instead of
			 /usr/adm/sa/pm_report.

     -rx		 Sets background mode sample rate to x,
			 where x is the number of seconds.

     -sMMddhhmmYY	 Sets start date in date(1) format of
			 collection process.

     -tx		 Includes statistics for system totals
			 for CPU in slot x, where x is the slot
			 number.

     -ufile		 Uses file for system kernel.

     -vx		 Includes statistics for virtual memory
			 subsystem for CPU in slot x, where x is
			 the slot number.

     -w 		 Includes statistics for system-wide
			 activity.

     -x 		 Examines LOG file on terminal screen.

EXAMPLES
     To start pm in foreground mode type the following:

	       pm -f

     To start pm in background mode at 8:00am on April 21, 1988,
     to collect general system metrics and information about the
     processor board in slot 4, type the following:

	       pm -bg4 -s0421080088

     To examine the data collected in an archived LOG file from a
     previous pm background task, type the following:

	       pm -x -L/usr/activity/pmlog_042188
