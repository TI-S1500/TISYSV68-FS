CD(1)                                                       CD(1)

NAME
     cd - Changes working directory

SYNOPSIS
     cd directory

DESCRIPTION
   Purpose
     The cd command changes the working directory to either the
     home directory (if no directory argument is specified) or to
     the specified directory.

   Discussion
     If directory is not specified, the value of shell parameter
     $HOME is used as the new working directory.  If directory
     specifies a complete path starting with /, ., or ..,
     directory becomes the new working directory.  If neither
     case applies, cd tries to find the designated directory
     relative to one of the paths specified by the $CDPATH shell
     variable.  $CDPATH has the same syntax as, and similar
     semantics to the $PATH shell variable.  The cd command must
     have execute (search) permission in directory.  Because a
     new process is created to execute each command, cd would be
     ineffective if it were written as a normal command.
     Therefore, cd is recognized and internal to the shell.

EXAMPLE
     Assume your current working directory is /usr/home/me.  The
     following command changes the working directory to
     /usr/home/me/accounts/national.

          cd accounts/national

     The following commands change the working directory to
     /usr/home/me/accounts.

          cd ../
          or
          cd ..
