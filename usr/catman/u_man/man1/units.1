NAME
     units - Specifies the conversion program

SYNOPSIS
     units

DESCRIPTION
     units converts quantities expressed in various standard
     scales to their equivalents in other scales.  It works
     interactively in this fashion (remember that you can
     exit units at any time by pressing Ctrl-c):

          You have:inch
          You want:cm
                  * 2.540000e+00
                  / 3.937008e-01

     A quantity is specified as a multiplicative combination of
     units optionally preceded by a numeric multiplier.  Powers
     are indicated by suffixed positive integers, division by the
     usual sign:

          You have:15 lbs force/in2
          You want:atm
                  * 1.020689e+00
                  / 9.797299e-01

     units only does multiplicative scale changes; thus, it can
     convert Kelvin to Rankine, but not Celsius to Fahrenheit.
     Most familiar units, abbreviations, and metric prefixes are
     recognized, including the following:
          pi       Ratio of circumference to diameter
          c        Speed of light
          e        Charge on an electron
          g        Acceleration of gravity
          force    Same as g
          mole     Avogadro's number
          water    Pressure head per unit height of water
          au       Astronomical unit

     Pound is not recognized as a unit of mass; lb is.  Compound
     names are run together, (e.g., lightyear).  British units
     that differ from their U.S. counterparts are prefixed, for
     example, brgallon.  For a complete list of units, enter:
