NAME
     ipcrm - Removes a message queue, semaphore, or shared memory
     ID

SYNOPSIS
     ipcrm -qmsQMS

DESCRIPTION
   Purpose
     The ipcrm command removes one or more specified messages,
     semaphores, or shared memory identifiers. This command can
     only be executed by the super-user.

     The details of the removals are described in msgctl(2),
     shmctl(2), and semctl(2).  The identifiers and keys may be
     found by using ipcs(1).

   Options
     -q msqid    Removes the message queue identifier msqid from
                 the system and destroys the message queue and
                 data structure associated with it.

     -m shmid    Removes the shared memory identifier shmid from
                 the system.  The shared memory segment and data
                 structure associated with it are destroyed after
                 the last detach.

     -s semid    Removes the semaphore identifier semid from the
                 system and destroys the set of semaphores and
                 data structure associated with it.

     -Q msgkey   Removes the message queue identifier, created
                 with key msgkey, from the system and destroys
                 the message queue and data structure associated
                 with it.

     -M shmkey   Removes the shared memory identifier, created
                 with key shmkey, from the system.  The shared
                 memory segment and data structure associated
                 with it are destroyed after the last detach.

     -S semkey   Removes the semaphore identifier, created with
                 key semkey, from the system and destroys the set
                 of semaphores and data structure associated with
                 it.
