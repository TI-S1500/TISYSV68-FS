LN(1)                                                       LN(1)

NAME
     ln - Links files

SYNOPSIS
     ln -f file1 target
     ln -f file1 [ file2 ...] targetdir

DESCRIPTION
   Purpose
     The file is linked to the target.

   Discussion
     Under no circumstance can file1 and target be the same (take
     care when using sh(1) metacharacters).  If target is a
     directory, then one or more files are linked to that
     directory.

     If ln determines that the mode of target forbids writing,
     the command prints the mode (see chmod(2)), asks for a
     response from the user, and reads the standard input for one
     line.  If the line begins with y, indicating yes, ln
     executes if permissible.  If changing modes is not
     permitted, the command exits.

   Option
     -f   Suppresses the prompt asking to change write permission
          and the command executes if this option is specified or
          if the standard input is not a terminal.

EXAMPLE
     Assume that the file named writeoff exists with user write
     permission off.  You wish to link the file named dummy to
     writeoff.  Enter the following command:

          ln dummy writeoff

     The following message is displayed:

          writeoff is write protected (mode=466).  Override? []

     Enter y and press RETURN.  The file named dummy is linked to
     writeoff, and the mode of file writeoff is now equal to that
     of dummy.

PROMPTS
   Input File or Directory Name(s):
     Enter the path name of the file or directory to be linked.

   Target File or Directory Name:
     Enter the new additional path name of the file or directory.

   Prompt to Change Write Permission:
     Initial value is yes.  If you enter no, the prompt asking to
     change write permission is suppressed.

SEE ALSO
     chmod(2), cp(1), cpio(1), mv(1), rm(1).

NOTES
     The ln program will not link across file systems.
