SHOWFS(1T)					       SHOWFS(1T)

NAME
     showfs - Displays information on a file system and allows
     the user to edit a block

SYNOPSIS
     showfs filesystem

DESCRIPTION
   Purpose
     The showfs command allows you to display information about
     inodes or blocks and to edit blocks.

   Discussion
     When you execute the command, information on the super block
     is displayed.  Using the commands described in the following
     text, you can show any inode or disk block, toggle between
     four and eight words per line while showing a disk block,
     and edit a disk block.

     Although showfs works on most ordinary files, the utility
     assumes that it is working with a real file system and
     extracts some constants from what should be the super block.
     These constants can contain the block numbers and inode
     numbers that can be displayed.  For viewing or editing an
     ordinary file, showhex(1T) is the preferred method.

   showfs Commands
     The following keys control the display:

     q or Q	       Exits to the shell

     Return	       Returns from the help screen

     S		       Shows the super block

     Inn	       Shows inode number nn, which is expected
		       to be a decimal number

     Bxnn	       Shows disk block number xnn, which is
		       expected to be a hex number

     ?		       Shows the help screen

     The following keys can be used within a hex display of a
     block:

     j or down arrow   Scrolls down one line

     k or up arrow     Scrolls up one line

     h or <-	       Scrolls left one character

     l or ->	       Scrolls right one character

     K or F-2	       Scrolls up 24 lines

     H or F-3	       Scrolls left four characters

     L or F-4	       Scrolls right four characters

     e		       Enters the edit mode (only while
		       displaying a block; press the q key to
		       exit the edit mode)

     w		       Writes a modified block back to disk
