KILLALL(1M)                                           KILLALL(1M)

NAME
     killall - Kills all active processes

SYNOPSIS
     killall [-drv] [signal]

DESCRIPTION
   Purpose
     The killall command is a procedure used by /etc/shutdown to
     kill all active processes not directly related to the
     shutdown procedure.

     killall is chiefly used to terminate all processes with open
     files so that the mounted file systems can be unmounted.

     This command sends signal to all remaining processes not
     belonging to the above group of exclusions.  If no signal
     (see kill(1)) is specified, a default of 15 is used.

   Options
     With options, killall can delay the shutdown procedure,
     allowing processes with extended cleanup needs ample time to
     properly exit.

     -d delay   The delay argument specifies the number of
                seconds between checks for processes that are
                still alive. This option has no effect if the -r
                option is not specified.

     -r retries The retries argument specifies the number of
                times for killall to look for processes that are
                still alive after being sent the specified
                signal. The default is 0 (not to delay and
                recheck).

     -v         Causes killall to display a warning message if
                processes still exist after the waiting period
                has expired.
