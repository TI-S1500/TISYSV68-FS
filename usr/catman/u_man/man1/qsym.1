QSYM(1T)                                                 QSYM(1T)

NAME
     qsym - Invokes the 68020 assembler symbol report generator

SYNOPSIS
     qsym -abcefhmsvx file
     qsym -abcefhmsvx [rpt]=file

DESCRIPTION
   Purpose
     The qsym command processes a symbol data file created by the
     68020 assembler source processor as(1T) or the linker text
     dump utility ltxdump(1T).  The qsym command produces a
     printable symbol report file that can contain symbol table,
     cross reference, and memory map reports.

   Options
     -a     Includes an abbreviated memory map report in the
            symbol report file.

     -b     Includes a combined symbol table and cross-reference
            report in the symbol report file.

     -c     Includes a compressed memory map report in the symbol
            report file.

     -e     Excludes local symbols from reports.

     -fpf   Overrides page format data in symbol data file with
            pf, the new page format specification.  Specify pf in
            the following format where ll is line length, pl is
            page length in lines, tm is top margin, and bm is
            bottom margin:

            ll,pl,tm,bm

     -hph   Overrides page heading data in the symbol data file
            with ph, the new page heading specification.  Specify
            ph as any combination of letters, numbers, and
            periods, where the period is used to delimit
            individual strings within the heading.  No embedded
            spaces are allowed.

     -m     Includes standard memory map report in the symbol
            report file.

     -s     Includes individual symbol table report in the symbol
            report file.

     -v     Inserts an ASCII formfeed character at the beginning
            of the symbol report file.

     -x     Includes individual cross reference report in the
            symbol report file.

   Argument
     rpt    User-defined symbol report output file name (the
            default file name suffix .rpt is appended to this
            value if no suffix is specified).

   Discussion
     The qsym command appends the default file name suffix .sym
     to the input file name if no suffix is specified.

     The default output file name suffix is .rpt (symbol report).

     Specify output file requirements in one of the following two
     ways:

     + If you omit the = from the command line, the output file
       name is derived by adding the default suffix .rpt to the
       input file name.

     + If you include the = and a user-defined symbol report
       output file name, the user-defined output file name is
       used.  The default suffix .rpt is appended to this value
       if no suffix is specified.  Note that if you include the =
       and do not specify a user-defined symbol report output
       file name, the output file name is derived as described in
       the first case above.

     The symbol table and the memory map can be generated only if
     the symbol data file was created using the -s option (as,
     ltxdump) or the -b option (as).  The cross reference can be
     generated only if the symbol data file was created using the
     -x or -b options (as).

     If no qsym report selection option (a, b, c, m, s, or x) is
     specified, individual symbol table and cross reference
     reports are produced if the symbol data file contains the
     necessary information.  A memory map is not produced unless
     specifically requested.

     See the TI System V 68020 Assembler manual for a detailed
     description of the qsym report format.

EXAMPLES
     The following example processes the input file lt30.sym and
     produces the output file lt30.rpt.  The -b option is used to
     request a combined symbol table and cross reference report.
     The m option is used to request a memory map report.

          qsym -bm lt30

     The following example processes the input file lt30.tmp and
     produces the output file lt30.rpt.

          qsym lt30.tmp

     The following example processes the input file lt30.sym and
