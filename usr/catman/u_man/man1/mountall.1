MOUNTALL(1M)                                         MOUNTALL(1M)

NAME
     mountall - Mounts multiple file systems

SYNOPSIS
     /etc/mountall [-] [file-system-table]  ...

DESCRIPTION
     This command can be executed only by the super-user.

     mountall  is used to mount file systems according to a
     file-system-table. (/etc/fstab is the default file system
     table.) The special file name - reads from the standard
     input.

     Before each file system is mounted, it is checked using
     fsstat(1M) to see if it appears mountable.  If the file
     system does not appear mountable, it is checked using
     fsck(1M) before the mount is attempted.

FILES
     file-system-table format:

	     parameter 1   Block special file name of file system

	     parameter 2   Mount-point directory

	     parameter 3   -r if to be mounted read-only

	     parameter 4   File system type string (optional)

	     parameter 5+  Ignored

     White space separates parameters.  Lines beginning with # are
     comments.  Empty lines are ignored.

     A typical file-system-table might read as follows:

          /dev/dsk/sys:usr /usr -r S51K

          /dev/disk/sys:pipe /pipe

     signal(2), umountall(1M).

DIAGNOSTICS
     No messages are printed if the file systems are mountable
     and clean.

     Error and warning messages come from fsck(1M), fsstat(1M),
     and mount(1M).
