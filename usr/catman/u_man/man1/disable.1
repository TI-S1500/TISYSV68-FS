DISABLE(1M)                                           DISABLE(1M)

NAME
     disable - Disables LP printers

SYNOPSIS
     disable [options] printers

DESCRIPTION
     The disable command deactivates the named printers,
     disabling them from printing requests taken by lp(1).  By
     default, any requests that are currently printing on the
     designated printers will be reprinted in their entirety
     either on the same printer or on another member of the same
     class.  Use lpstat(1) to find the status of printers.
     Options for use with disable are:

     -c          Cancels any requests that are currently printing
                 on any of the designated printers.  This option
                 cannot be used with the -W option.

     -r reason   Assigns a reason for the disabling of the
                 printers.  This reason applies to all printers
                 mentioned up to the next -r option.  This reason
                 is reported by lpstat(1).  If the -r option is
                 not present, a default reason will be used. If
                 reason contains embedded blanks, you must enclose 
                 reason in double quotes. 

     -W          Disables the specified printers when the print
                 requests currently printing have finished.  This
                 option cannot be used with the -c option.
