SLOTLOAD(1T)                                         SLOTLOAD(1T)

NAME
     slotload - Restart the CCB in a specified slot

SYNOPSIS
     slotload slot

DESCRIPTION
   Purpose
     The slotload command restarts a single CCB.  The slot
     argument is the slot number of the chassis slot containing
     the CCB to be restarted.  It is used in the case of a
     failure of a single CCB in a multiple CCB system.  In many
     cases, it is not necessary to reboot the entire system if a
     CCB software failure has occurred.  This command executes
     that portion of the boot time activity which is directed at
     the specified CCB.
