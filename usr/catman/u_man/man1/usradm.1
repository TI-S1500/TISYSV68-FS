NAME
     usradm - Manages user accounts

SYNOPSIS
     usradm

DESCRIPTION
   Purpose
     The usradm command allows the system administrator to alter
     the password file and to add or delete user accounts and
     user files.  This command is interactive.	After entering
     usradm, the user responds to screen menus and prompts.  This
     command requires invocation by the super-user.  See the TI
     System V Administrator's Guide for a detailed discussion of
     the menus and prompts.

     The HOME DIRECTORY column shows the users' home directories.
     Other screens are available via use of the F9 key.

     One of the usradm screen displays allows you to configure

     must be edited to add a new group.  This must be done prior
     to adding user accounts to the new group with usradm.

     The command line of the first display consists of words that
     indicate the operations available.  Each different screen
     type has a different list of available commands.  Use the F9
     key to see all the displays and available commands.  Select
     the user information to alter by positioning the cursor by
     the desired user ID.  Select an operation by pressing the
     key that corresponds to the a boldface letter on the command
     line.
