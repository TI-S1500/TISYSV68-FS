NAME
     time - Times a command

SYNOPSIS
     time command

DESCRIPTION
   Purpose
     After the command is executed, time prints the time elapsed
     during the command, the time spent in the system, and the
     time spent in execution of the command.  Times are reported
     in seconds and are printed on standard error.

     A command is any command supplied by the system or by the
     user.

EXAMPLE

     for a command executed in the Business shell, bsh(1):

          time ls -l

          1.4u   5.6s   0:25   27%

     The output is as follows:

     1.4u  User time.

     5.6s  System time.

     0:25  Real time.

     27%   Percentage of real time in which the cpu was active
           (the sum of the user and system times divided by the
           real time).

     The following example shows the output of the same command
     executed in the Bourne shell, sh(1):

          real   21.2
