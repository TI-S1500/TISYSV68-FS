LS(1)                                                       LS(1)

NAME
     ls - Lists the contents of directories

SYNOPSIS
     ls -abcCdDfFgilmnopqrRstux names

DESCRIPTION
   Purpose
     The ls command lists the contents of each named directory.
     The command repeats the file name and any other information
     requested for each file named.

     By default, the output is sorted alphabetically.  When no
     argument is given, the current directory is listed.  When
     several arguments are given, the arguments are first sorted
     appropriately, but file arguments are processed before
     directories and their contents.

     There are three major listing formats. The default format is
     to list one entry per line, the -C and -x options enable
     multi-column formats, and the -m option enables stream
     output format.

   Options
     -a   Lists all entries.  In the absence of this option,
          entries whose names begin with a period (.)  are not
          listed.

     -b   Forces the printing of non-printable characters in the
          octal notation (\ddd).

     -c   Uses time of last modification of the i-node (that is,
          time when file was created, mode was changed, and so
          on) instead of last modification of the file for
          sorting (with -t option) or printing (with -l option).

     -C   Arranges the output in several columns, sorted down
          within the columns.

     -d   If the argument is a directory, lists only its name and
          not its contents.  This option is often used with -l to
          get the status of a directory.

     -D   Omits the time from the long display.

     -f   Forces each argument to be interpreted as a directory
          and lists the name found in each slot.  This option
          turns off -l, -t, -s, and -r, and turns on -a in the
          order in which entries appear in the directory.

     -F   Puts a slash after the name of each directory and an
          asterisk after the name of an executable file.

     -g   Does not print the owner; otherwise, like -l.

     -i   For each file, prints the i-number in the first column
          of the report.

     -l   Lists in long format, giving mode, number of links,
          owner, group, size in bytes, and time of last
          modification for each file.  If the file is a special
          file, the size field contains the major and minor
          device numbers, rather than a size.

     -m   Lists the file names as a stream, with commas
          separating the names.

     -n   Shows owner and group ID number rather than name.
          Otherwise, like the -l option.

     -o   Does not print the group; otherwise, like -l.

     -p   Puts a slash after the name of each directory.  This
          option is especially useful for VDTs when combined with
          the pr(1) command as follows:
          ls -p | pr -5 -t -w80

     -q   Forces the printing of non-printable characters in a
          file name as a question mark (?).

     -r   Reverses the order of sort to get reverse alphabetic or
          oldest first, as appropriate.

     -R   Recursively lists all subdirectories within names.

     -s   Gives size in 1K-byte blocks (including indirect
          blocks) for each entry.

     -t   Sorts by the time of last modification (with latest
          first) rather than by name.  The time of last
          modification is the default time.  Can be used in
          conjunction with -c and -u to sort by a different time.

     -u   Uses time of last access instead of last modification
          for sorting (with the -t option) and/or printing (with
          the -l option).

     -x   Arranges the output in columns, sorted left to right
          across each line.

-l Option
     The mode printed under the -l option consists of 11
     characters that are interpreted as follows:

     The first character is:

     d   If the entry is a directory
     b   If the entry is a block special file
     c   If the entry is a character special file
     p   If the entry is a fifo (a.k.a. ``named pipe'') special
         file
     -   If the entry is an ordinary file

     The next nine characters are interpreted as three sets of
     three bits each.  The first set refers to the owner's
     permissions, the next to permissions of others in the user
     group of the file, and the last to all others.  Within each
     set, the three characters indicate permission to read, to
     write, and to execute the file as a program, respectively.
     For a directory, execute permission is interpreted to mean
     permission to search the directory for a specified file.

     The permissions are indicated as follows:

     r   If the file is readable
     w   If the file is writable
     x   If the file is executable
     s   If the file is specified to set ID upon execution
     -   If the indicated permission is not granted
     l   If the file is locked during access (mandatory locking is
         enabled when the set-group-ID bit is on and the group
         execution bit is off)

     The group-execute permission character is given as the s
     permission if the file has set-group-ID mode; likewise, the
     user-execute permission character is given as the s
     permission if the file has set-user-ID mode.  The last
     character of the mode (normally x or -) is the letter t if
     the 1000 (octal) bit of the mode is on; see chmod(1) for the
     meaning of this mode.  The indications of set-ID and 1000
     bit of the mode are capitalized ( S and T respectively) if
     the corresponding execute permission is not set.

     The 11th character will contain an f if the file is a
     forced-write file; otherwise, it will be blank.
     
     In the case of the sequence of group permissions, the letter l
     may occupy the third position. l refers to mandatory file and
     record locking. This permission describes a file's ability to
     allow other files to lock its reading or writing permissions
     during access.
     When the sizes of the files in a directory are listed, a
     total count of blocks, including indirect blocks, is printed
     with the -s option.  With the -l option, the size is printed
     in bytes.

EXAMPLE
     The following example lists the contents of directory dir1
     and reports the permission status of each file in dir1.

          ls -l dir1

          -rwxrwxrwx  1  smith  dev   10876   May 16  9:42  part2

     This horizontal configuration provides a good deal of
     information.  Reading from right to left, you see that the
     dir1 directory holds one file, named part2. Next, the last
     time that file's contents were modified was 9:42 am on May
     16. The file is moderately sized, containing 10,876
     characters, or bytes. The owner of the file, or the user,
     belongs to the group "dev" (perhaps indicating
     "development"), and the user's login name is "smith." The
     number, in this case "1," indicates the number of links to
     file part2. Finally, the row of dash and letters tell you
     that user, group, and others have permissions to read,
     write, and execute part2.
