SYNOPSIS
     mtcstat -ps [mtcnames]

DESCRIPTION
   Function
     The mtcstat command lists information about the specified
     multidrop terminal concentrators (MTCs).  The mtcstat
     command can be used to determine if the MTC is currently
     operational and running with the correct software and
     hardware versions.

   Options
     -p port
	  Displays status of all MTCs defined on this
	  communications carrier board (CCB) option port.  This
	  option is only valid when entered along with the -s
	  option.

     -s slot
	  Displays status of all MTCs defined on this CCB slot.

   Arguments
     mtcnames
	    An MTC global name or a list of MTC global names as
	    specified in the MTC definition file, /etc/mtctab.
	    Without mtcnames specified, the command lists the
	    status information of all the MTCs defined in the MTC
	    definition file, /etc/mtctab.

EXAMPLES
     The following are example command lines for the mtcstat
     command:

	  mtcstat payroll mtc0
	  mtcstat

     The following is an example of status information returned
     by mtcstat upon normal completion:

     NAME  STATUS		 ROM		     CCB  PORT ADDR  DUMP
     mtc0  mtcload 1.0 10/31/89  1.04 CK802 10/24/89 03   0    1     disabled
     tc1   mtcload 1.0 10/31/89  1.04 CK802 10/24/89 03   1    0     enabled
     junk  OFFLINE				     03   1    1     disabled

     The meanings of the columns are as follows:

     NAME	  MTC global name.  Maximum length is 8
		  characters.

     STATUS	  The current running state of the MTC.  There
		  are 5 possible status conditions returned by
		  the utility:

		  RAM version - The MTC is running in the
		  downloaded code (RAM) and is operational.  The
		  RAM version number and date of the downloaded
		  software is displayed.

		  WAITING - The MTC is running in the ROM
		  download code.  The download process, mtcdl,
		  has not started the download process yet.

		  DNLDING - The MTC is running in the ROM
		  download code.  The download is in progress.

		  UPLDING - The MTC is sending the memory dump to
		  the host.  The MTC is running in the ROM
		  download code. The download will be started
		  when the memory dump is finished.

		  OFFLINE - No response has been received from
		  the MTC.  This may indicate that the MTC is
		  powered off or has encountered software or
		  hardware problems.  Further investigation into
		  the cause for the status is needed.

     ROM	  The version number and date of the ROM in the
		  MTC is displayed.

     CCB	  The chassis slot number of the communications
		  carrier board (CCB) that is associated with the
		  specified MTC.

     PORT	  The CCB port number that is associated with the
		  specified MTC.

     ADDR	  The address of the MTC.

     DUMP	  If the memory dump capability of that MTC is
		  enabled, the word enabled is displayed.  See
		  mtcdump(1T).
