STRERR(1M)                                             STRERR(1M)

NAME
     strerr - Specifies the STREAMS error logger daemon

SYNOPSIS
     strerr

DESCRIPTION
     strerr receives error log messages from the STREAMS log
     driver [log(7)] and appends them to a log file.  The error
     log files produced reside in the directory /usr/adm/streams,
     and are named error.mm-dd, where mm is the month and dd is
     the day of the messages contained in each log file.

     The format of an error log message is:

     <seq> <time> <ticks> <flags> <mid> <sid> <text>

          <seq>     Error sequence number

          <time>    Time of message in hh:mm:ss

          <ticks>   Time of message in machine ticks since boot
                    priority level

          <flags>   T : the message was also sent to a tracing
                    process
                    F : indicates a fatal error
                    N : send mail to the system administrator

          <mid>     Module ID number of source

          <sid>     Sub-ID number of source

          <text>    Formatted text of the error message

     Messages that appear in the error log are intended to report
     exceptional conditions that require the attention of the
     system administrator.  Those messages that indicate the
     total failure of a STREAMS driver or module should have the
     F flag set.  Those messages requiring the immediate
     attention of the administrator will have the N flag set,
     which causes the error logger to send the message to the
     system administrator via mail(1).  The priority level
     usually has no meaning in the error log but will have
     meaning if the message is also sent to a tracer process.

     Once initiated, strerr will continue to execute until
     terminated by the user.  Commonly, strerr would be executed
     asynchronously.

CAVEATS
     Only one strerr process at a time is permitted to open the
     STREAMS log driver.

     If a module or driver is generating a large number of error
     messages, running the error logger will cause a degradation
     in STREAMS performance.  If a large burst of messages are
     generated in a short time, the log driver may not be able to
     deliver some of the messages.  This situation is indicated
     by gaps in the sequence numbering of the messages in the log
     files.
