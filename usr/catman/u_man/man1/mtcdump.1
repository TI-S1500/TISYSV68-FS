MTCDUMP(1T)					      MTCDUMP(1T)

NAME
     mtcdump - Enables or disables the dump capability of
     multidrop terminal concentrators

SYNOPSIS
     mtcdump -dDnN [mtcnames]

DESCRIPTION
   Function
     The mtcdump command turns on or off the memory dump
     capability of the multidrop terminal concentrators (MTCs).
     If the dump capability of an MTC has been enabled, every
     time the multidrop terminal concentrator is re-downloaded, a
     memory dump is taken by the host and is saved in a dump
     output file for further analysis.	The download will not
     proceed until the dump completes.

     Unless specially disabled by the mtcdump command, each MTC
     has the memory dump enabled.  The default dump output file
     for mtcname is /usr/adm/comlog/dumpmtcname.  The dump is a
     532K-byte memory image.

   Options
     -d     Enables the dump capability of the MTCs specified by
	    mtcnames for future MTC memory dumps.

     -D     Enables the dump capability of all the MTCs defined
	    in the MTC definition file, /etc/mtctab.

     -n     Disables the dump capability of the MTCs specified by
	    mtcnames.

     -N     Disables the dump capability of all the MTCs defined
	    in the MTC definition file, /etc/mtctab.

   Arguments
     mtcnames
	    An MTC global name or a list of MTC global names as
	    specified in the MTC definition file, /etc/mtctab.
