TOUCH(1)                                                 TOUCH(1)

NAME
     touch - Updates access and modification times of a file

SYNOPSIS
     touch -acm [mmddhhmm[yy] ] files

DESCRIPTION
   Purpose
     The touch command causes the access and modification times
     of each argument to be updated.

   Options
     -a   Updates only the access times (The default is -am.)

     -c   Silently prevents touch from creating the file if it
          did not previously exist

     -m   Updates only the modification times

   Discussion
     The first mm is the month number, dd is the day number in
     the month, hh is the hour number (24-hour system), the
     second mm is the minute number, and yy is the last two
     digits of the year number and is optional.

     The return code from touch is the number of files for which
     the times could not be successfully modified (including
     files that did not exist and were not created).

     If no time is specified (see date(1)) the current time is
     used.

EXAMPLE
     The following example causes the modification time of file1
     to be changed to 08:15 October 3 of the current year:

          touch -m 10030815 file1
