UMOUNTALL(1M)                                       UMOUNTALL(1M)

NAME
     umountall - Unmounts multiple file systems

SYNOPSIS
     /etc/umountall [ -k ]

DESCRIPTION
     This command can be executed only by the super-user.

     umountall causes all mounted file systems except root to be
     unmounted.  The -k option sends a SIGKILL signal, via
     fuser(1M), to processes that have files open.

FILES
     file-system-table format:

	     parameter 1   Block special file name of file system

	     parameter 2   Mount-point directory

	     parameter 3   -r if to be mounted read-only

	     parameter 4   File system type string (optional)

	     parameter 5+  Ignored

     White space separates parameters.  Lines beginning with # are
     comments.  Empty lines are ignored.

     A typical file-system-table might read as follows:

          /dev/dsk/sys:usr /usr -r S51K

          /dev/disk/sys:pipe/pipe

SEE ALSO
     fsck(1M), fsstat(1M), fstab(4), fuser(1M), mount(1M),
     mountall(1M), signal(2).

DIAGNOSTICS
     No messages are printed if the file systems are mountable
     and clean.

     Error and warning messages come from fsck(1M), fsstat(1M),
     and mount(1M).
