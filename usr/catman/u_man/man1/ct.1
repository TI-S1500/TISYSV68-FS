CT(1C)                                                     CT(1C)

NAME
     ct - Spawns a getty process to a remote terminal

SYNOPSIS
     ct -hsvw telnos

DESCRIPTION
   Purpose
     The ct command dials the phone number of a modem that is
     attached to a terminal and spawns a getty process to that
     terminal.

   Options
     -h    Normally, ct hangs up the current line to allow that
           line to answer the incoming call.  The -h option
           prevents this action.

     -sspeed
           The -s option sets the data rate, where speed is
           expressed in baud.  The default rate is 300.

     -v    The -v option sends a running narrative to the
           standard error output stream.

     -wn   The -w option suppresses the prompt that asks how long
           the command should wait for an open line.  The value n
           is the maximum number of minutes that ct is to wait
           for a line.

   Discussion
     The telnos argument is one or more telephone numbers with
     equal signs (=) for secondary dial tones and minus signs (-)
     for delays at appropriate places.  If more than one
     telephone number is specified, ct tries each in succession
     until one answers.  This feature is useful for specifying
     alternate dialing paths.

     The ct command tries each line listed in the file
     /usr/lib/uucp/L-devices until it finds an available line
     with appropriate attributes or runs out of entries.  If
     there are no free lines, ct asks if it should wait for one,
     and if so, for how many minutes it should wait before it
     gives up.  The command continues to try to open the dialers
     at one-minute intervals until the specified limit is
     exceeded.

     After the user on the destination terminal logs out, ct
     prompts, Reconnect?.  If the response begins with the letter
     n, the line is dropped.  Otherwise, getty is started again
     and the login:  prompt is printed.

     Of course, the destination terminal must be attached to a
     modem that can answer the telephone.

     Response to this prompt is optional.  Enter a number that
     indicates the maximum number of minutes to wait for a line.

   Baud Rate to Use:
     Response to this prompt is optional.  Enter the baud rate
     that you want - 110, 150, 300, 600, 1200, 4800, or 9600. The
     default is 300 baud.
