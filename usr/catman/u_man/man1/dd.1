NAME
     dd - Converts and copies a file

SYNOPSIS
     dd option=value

DESCRIPTION
   Purpose
     The dd program copies the specified input file to the
     specified output with possible conversions.  The standard
     input and output are used by default.  The input and output
     block size may be specified to take advantage of raw
     physical I/O.

   Options
     Option	     Value Descriptions

     if=file	     Sets input file name; standard input is
		     default

     of=file	     Sets output file name; standard output is
		     default

     ibs=n	     Sets input block size n bytes (default 512)

     obs=n	     Sets output block size (default 512)

     bs=n	     Sets both input and output block size,
		     superseding ibs and obs; also, if no
		     conversion is specified, it is particularly
		     efficient since no in-core copy need be done

     cbs=n	     Sets conversion buffer size (see Discussion
		     below)

     skip=n	     Skips n input records before starting copy

     seek=n	     Seeks n records from beginning of output
		     file before copying

     count=n	     Copies only n input records

     conv=ascii      Converts EBCDIC to ASCII

	  ebcdic     Converts ASCII to EBCDIC

	  ibm	     Provides slightly different map of ASCII to
		     EBCDIC; (there is no inverse conversion for
		     this code.)

	  lcase      Maps alphabetics to lower case

	  ucase      Maps alphabetics to upper case

	  swab	     Swaps every pair of bytes

	  noerror    Does not stop processing on an error

	  sync	     Pads every input record to ibs

		     Note that multiple conversions can be
		     specified with comma delimiters.

   Discussion
     Where sizes are specified, a number of bytes is expected.	A
     number may end with k, b, or w to specify multiplication by
     1024, 512, or 2 respectively; a pair of numbers may be
     separated by x to indicate a product.

     The cbs option is used only if ascii or ebcdic conversion is
     specified.  In the former case, cbs characters are placed
     into the conversion buffer, converted to ASCII. Trailing
     blanks are trimmed and a newline is added before sending the
     line to the output.  In the latter case, ASCII characters
     are read into the conversion buffer and converted to EBCDIC,
     and blanks are added to make up an output record of size
     cbs.  Any line longer than cbs characters is truncated to
     cbs characters.

     After completion, dd reports the number of whole and partial
     input and output blocks as follows:

	  dd read xxx full blocks and yy partial blocks
	  dd wrote xxx full blocks and yy partial blocks

EXAMPLE
     This command reads an EBCDIC tape blocked ten 80-byte EBCDIC
     card images per record into the ASCII file x:

	  dd  if=/dev/rqt/0h  of=x  ibs=800  cbs=80  conv=ascii,lcase

     Note the use of raw magtape.  The dd program is especially
     suited to I/O on the raw physical devices because it allows
     reading and writing in arbitrary record sizes.

PROMPTS
   Input File Name:
     Enter the input file name.

   Input Block Size:
     Enter the output block size in bytes.  The default is 512
     bytes.

   Output File Name:
     Enter the output file name.

   Output Block Size:
     Enter the input block size in bytes.  The default is 512
     bytes.

   Number of Records to Skip:
     Enter the number of input records to skip before starting to
     copy.  The default is none.

   Number of Records to Seek:
     Enter the number of records to seek from the beginning of
     the output file before copying.  The default is all.

   Number of Input Records to Copy:
     Enter the number of input records to be copied.  The default
     is all.

   Select Conversion Options:
     Initial value is n.  If you select yes, the following
     conversion prompts appear:

   Output File Exists. Replace File?:
     Enter yes to allow dd to replace an output file that already
     exists.  The initial value is no.

   Conversion Buffer Size:
     Enter the conversion buffer size.	The default is none.

   Convert EBCDIC to ASCII:
     Initial value is no.  If you enter yes, the input file is
     converted from EBCDIC to ASCII.

   Convert ASCII to EBCDIC:
     Initial value is no.  If you enter yes, the input file is
     converted from ASCII to EBCDIC.

   Map Alphabetics to Lower Case:
     Initial value is no.  If you enter yes, the input file is
     converted to lower case.

   Map Alphabetics to Upper Case:
     Initial value is no.  If you enter yes, the input file is
     converted to upper case.

   Swap Every Pair of Bytes:
     Initial value is no.  If you enter yes, the input file bytes
     are swapped.

   Stop Processing on an Error:
     Initial value is yes.  If you enter yes, the command is not
     terminated on an error.

   Pad Input Record to Input Block Size:
     Initial value is no.  If you enter yes, the input file
     records are padded to the input block size.

     cp(1).

NOTES
     The ASCII/EBCDIC conversion tables are taken from the 256-
     character standard in the CACM Nov, 1968.	The ibm
     conversion, while less accepted as a standard, corresponds
     better to certain IBM(R) print train conventions.

     Newlines are inserted only on conversion to ASCII, and
     padding is done only on conversion to EBCDIC.  These should
     be separate options.

     If the output is directed to a raw 1/4-inch tape and the
     input is a file, dd will fail because 1/4-inch tape hardware
     writes only in multiples of 1024 bytes.

     If the output file exists then the following warning is
     given:

	  DD -- REPLACE FILE OPTION
	    Output File Exists. Replace File:

     The default response to this prompt is no.
