REGCMP(1)                                               REGCMP(1)

NAME
     regcmp - Compiles regular expressions

SYNOPSIS
     regcmp - files

DESCRIPTION
   Purpose
     The regcmp command compiles the regular expressions in file
     and places the output in file.i.  This command, in most
     cases, precludes the need for calling regcmp(3X) from C
     programs.  This saves on both execution time and program
     size.

   Options
     -    Output is placed in file.c.

   Discussion
     The format of entries in file is a name (C variable)
     followed by one or more blanks followed by a regular
     expression enclosed in double quotes.  The output of regcmp
     is C source code.  Compiled regular expressions are
     represented as extern char vectors.  File.i files may thus
     be included into C programs using #include, or file.c files
     may be compiled and later loaded.  In the C program that
     uses the regcmp output, regex(abc,line) will apply the
     regular expression named abc to line.

EXAMPLES
     A file named a is composed of the following lines:

          name     "([A-Za-z][A-Za-z0-9_]*)$0"

     A file named b is composed of the following lines:

          telno    "\({0,1}([2-9][01][1-9])$0\){0,1} *"
                   "([2-9][0-9]{2})$1[ -]{0,1}"
                   "([0-9]{4})$2"

     The following regcmp command line compiles files a and b and
     creates the files a.i and b.i:

          regcmp a b

PROMPTS
   Input File(s):
     Enter the names of the files to be expanded.

   Place Output Into filename.c:
     Initial value is no.  If you enter yes, the output of the
     process will be placed into the file name specified above
     appended with .c.  If you accept the default, the output
     will go to filename.i.
