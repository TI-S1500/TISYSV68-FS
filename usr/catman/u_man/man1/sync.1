SYNC(1M)                                                 SYNC(1M)

NAME
     sync - Updates the super block

SYNOPSIS
     sync

DESCRIPTION
   Purpose
     The sync command executes the sync system call.  If the
     system is to be stopped, sync must be called to ensure file
     system integrity.

   Discussion
     This command flushes all previously unwritten system buffers
     to disk, thus assuring that all file modifications up to
     that point are saved.  See sync(2) for details.

EXAMPLE
     To write the contents of previously unwritten system buffers
     out to disk, type the following command:

          sync

SEE ALSO
     sync(2).
