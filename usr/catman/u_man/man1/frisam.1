FRISAM(1T)						 FRISAM(1T)

NAME
     frisam - Reads data from a T-ISAM file and copies to
     standard output.

SYNOPSIS
     frisam -BeEfFknpsS data_file [index_file]

DESCRIPTION
   Purpose
     The frisam command reads data from a T-ISAM file in physical
     or key order and copies it to a specified sequential (flat)
     file or to standard output.

   Discussion
     If index_file is specified, it will be used. If it is not
     specified, the index file associated with the data file will
     be used.

   Options
     -B      Like -F, except fills with spaces rather than nulls.

     -e      Provides exclusive access while the T-ISAM file is
	     read and returns "file locked" error if the
	     T-ISAM file is currently open by another process.

     -E rec  Ends reading at the last occurrence of the record
	     specified. This option is not valid if -p is
	     selected.	rec is a character string containing the
	     record image with the desired starting key value in
	     the correct locations within the record.  The value
	     of characters in non-key positions is not
	     significant.  rec must contain only printable
	     character data-the key type must be character.

     -f file Writes output to file. If this option is not
	     specified, output is written to standard output.

     -F      Fills from the end of the record to the maximum
	     record size (as defined by the -s option or by the
	     T-ISAM file's maximum record size) with null
	     characters.

     -k id   Reads the file ordered by key id.	An id of 1 refers
	     to the primary key, an id of 2 refers to the next
	     key, and so on. See the mapisam utility to determine
	     the key ID of various keys.  -k and -p cannot both
	     be selected. If neither -k nor -p is selected, the
	     file will be read in primary key order.

     -n      Inserts a new-line character between each record.

     -p      Reads the file in physical order.	-p and -k cannot
	     both be selected.

     -s siz  Uses a (maximum) record size of siz. If this is not
	     declared, the maximum record size of the
	     T-ISAM file will be used. If a record is larger than
	     this maximum size, it will be truncated.

     -S rec  Starts reading at the first occurrence of the record
	     specified. This option is not valid if -p is
	     selected. rec is a character string with the desired
	     starting key value in the correct locations within
	     the record.  rec must contain only printable
	     character data-the key type must be character.

EXAMPLE
     The following example copies all the data from the T-ISAM
     file tismfile.dat (using the index specified by
     tismfile.dat) in physical order to the flat file datafile.
     All records will be truncated or null-filled to a length of
     100 bytes.

	  frisam -f datafile -p -s 100 -F tismfile.dat

     The following example assumes that key 2 of the T-ISAM file
     begins in byte 6 and is 25 bytes long. This example will
     copy all records with key number 2 beginning "Jones". Output
     records will be truncated to 31 characters, and a newline
     character will be inserted between each output record.
     Output is written to standard output and piped into the sed
     utility, which (in this example) will remove the first 6
     characters from each record.  The resulting data is copied
     to the file datfile.

	  frisam -k 2 -n -s 31 \
		 -S "------Jones
	  "\
		 -E "------Jones~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~"\
		 tismfile.dat tismfile.idx .br | sed -e
	  's/^......//'> datfile

PROMPTS
   T-ISAM Data File:
     Enter the data portion of the T-ISAM file to be copied.

   T-ISAM Index File:
     Optional. Enter the index portion of the T-ISAM file to be
     copied.

   Output File:
     Optional. Enter the sequential file into which the T-ISAM
     data will be copied.  If this parameter is omitted, the data
     will be scrolled on the screen.

   Sort by Key Number:
     Optional. Enter the key number by which the data should be
     ordered. If this is omitted, key 1 (the primary key) will be
     used.

   Record Size:
     Optional. Data larger than this size will be truncated. If
     the "Null Fill" option (below) is selected, records will be
     null-filled to this size.	If this is omitted, the maximum
     record size of the T-ISAM file will be used.

   Insert Newline? (y/n):
     The default is yes.  If this is selected, a new-line
     character (ASCII LF) will be inserted between records.

   Null or Blank Fill? (n/b/):
     The default is null fill.	If n or b is selected, null
     characters (ASCII NUL) or spaces will be added to the end of
     the record until the record is the Maximum Record Size, as
     defined by the Record Size prompt (above) or, if that is not
     defined, by the T-ISAM file. If no response is selected, the
     record will not be padded.

   Exclusive Access? (y/n):
     The default is yes.  If this is selected, the T-ISAM file
     will be opened for exclusive access.  If the file is already
     opened, this utility will fail. Any attempt to open the T-ISAM
     file while this utility is using it will fail.
