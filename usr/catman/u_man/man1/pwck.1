NAME
     pwck - Checks password file

SYNOPSIS
     pwck [file]

DESCRIPTION
   Purpose
     The pwck command scans the password file and notes any
     inconsistencies.  The checks include validation of the
     number of fields, the login name, the user ID, and the group
     ID.  The command also determines whether the login directory
     and optional program name exist.  The criteria for
     determining a valid login name is explained in User
     Management in the TI System V Administrator's Guide.  The
     default password file is /etc/passwd. Only super-user can
     use this command.
