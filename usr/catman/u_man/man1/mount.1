MOUNT(1M)                                               MOUNT(1M)

NAME
     mount - Mounts file systems and remote resources

SYNOPSIS
     /etc/mount [-r] [-f fstyp] special directory
     /etc/mount

DESCRIPTION
     File systems other than root ( / ) are considered removable
     in the sense that they can be either available to users or
     unavailable.  mount announces to the system that special, a
     block special device is available to users from the mount
     point directory. directory must exist already; it becomes
     the name of the root of the newly mounted special. Mutiple
     mounts of a single special device are not permitted.

     mount, when entered with arguments, adds an entry to the
     table of mounted devices, /etc/mnttab.  umount removes the
     entry.  If invoked with no arguments, mount prints the
     entire mount table.  If invoked with any of the following
     partial argument lists, mount will search /etc/fstab to fill
     in the missing arguments:  special or directory.

     The following options are available:

     -r         Indicates that special is to be mounted read-only.
                If special is write-protected, this flag must be
                used.

     -f fstyp   Indicates that fstyp is the file system type to
                be mounted.  If this argument is omitted, it
                defaults to the root fstyp.

     special    Indicates the block special device that is to be
                mounted on directory.

     directory  Indicates the directory mount point for special.
                (The directory must already exist.)

     Only the super-user can execute the mount command.

FILES
     /etc/mnttab      Specifies the mount table
     /etc/fstab       Specifies the file system table

SEE ALSO
     fstab(4), fuser(1M), mnttab(4), mount(2), setmnt(1M),
     umount(2).

DIAGNOSTICS
     If the mount(2) system call fails, mount prints an
     appropriate diagnostic.  mount issues a warning if the file
     system to be mounted is currently labeled under another
     name.
