XARGS(1)                                                 XARGS(1)

NAME
     xargs - Constructs argument list(s) and executes command

SYNOPSIS
     xargs -eilnpstx [command[initial-arguments]]

DESCRIPTION
   Purpose
     The xargs command combines the fixed initial-arguments with
     arguments read from standard input to execute the specified
     command one or more times.  The number of arguments read for
     each command invocation and the manner in which they are
     combined are determined by the specified options.

   Options
     Each argument list is constructed starting with the
     initial-arguments, followed by some number of arguments read
     from standard input (Except for the -i option).  Options -i,
     -l, and -n determine how arguments are selected for each
     command invocation.  When none of these options is coded,
     the initial-arguments are followed by arguments read
     continuously from standard input until an internal buffer is
     full; then command is executed with the accumulated args.
     This process is repeated until there are no more arguments.
     When there are option conflicts (such as when -l and -n are
     both given), the last option has precedence.  Options and
     their values are as follows:

     -eeofstr  The eofstr value is taken as the logical end-of-
               file string.  Underbar (_) is assumed for the
               logical EOF string if -e is not coded.  The -e
               option with no eofstr coded turns off the logical
               EOF string capability The underbar is taken
               literally.  The xargs command reads standard input
               until either end-of-file signal or the logical EOF
               string is encountered.

     -ireplstr This option sets insert mode.  The command is
               executed for each line from standard input, taking
               the entire line as a single argument and inserting
               it in initial-arguments for each occurrence of
               replstr.  A maximum of 5 arguments in initial-
               arguments can each contain one or more instances
               of replstr.  Blanks and tabs at the beginning of
               each line are thrown away.  Constructed arguments
               cannot grow larger than 255 characters, and option
               -x is also forced.  If not specified, {} is
               assumed for replstr.

     -lnumber  Command is executed for each nonempty number lines
               of arguments from standard input.  The last
               invocation of command is with fewer lines of
               arguments if fewer than number remain.  A line is
               considered to end with the first newline unless
               the last character of the line is a blank or a
               tab; a trailing blank or tab signals continuation
               through the next nonempty line.  If number is
               omitted, 1 is assumed.  Option -x is forced.

     -nnumber  Execute command using as many standard input
               arguments as possible, up to number arguments
               maximum.  Fewer arguments are used if their total
               size is greater than size characters and for the
               last invocation if there are fewer than number
               arguments remaining.  If option -x is also coded,
               each number arguments must fit in the size
               limitation; otherwise, xargs terminates execution.

     -p        This option sets prompt mode. The user is asked
               whether to execute command each invocation. Trace
               mode (-t) is turned on to print the command
               instance to be executed, followed by a ?...
               prompt.  A reply of y (optionally followed by
               anything) executes the command; anything else,
               including just a carriage return, skips that
               particular invocation of command.

     -ssize    The maximum total size of each argument list is
               set to size characters; size must be a positive
               integer less than or equal to 470. If -s is not
               coded, 470 is taken as the default.  Note that the
               character count for size includes the count of
               characters in the command name and one extra
               character for each argument.

     -t        This option sets trace mode. The command and each
               constructed argument list are echoed to file
               descriptor 2 just prior to their execution.

     -x        Causes xargs to terminate if any argument list
               would be greater than size characters; -x is
               forced by the options -i and -l.  When none of the
               options -i, -l, or -n is coded, the total length
               of all arguments must be within the size limit.

   Discussion
     The xargs command accesses the user's $PATH to search for
     command, which may be a shell file.  If command is omitted,
     the file /bin/echo is used.

     Arguments read in from standard input are defined to be
     contiguous strings of characters delimited by one or more
     blanks, tabs, or newlines.  Empty lines are always
     discarded.  Blanks and tabs may be embedded as part of an
     argument if escaped or quoted; characters enclosed in quotes
     (single or double) are taken literally, and the delimiting
     quotes are removed.  Outside quoted strings, a backslash (\)
     escapes the next character.

     The xargs command terminates if it receives a return code of
     -1 from command or if it cannot execute command.  When
     command is a shell program, it should explicitly exit (see
     sh(1)) with an appropriate value to avoid accidentally
     returning with -1.

EXAMPLES
     The following Bourne shell, sh(1), command moves all files
     from directory $1 to directory $2, and echoes each move
     command just before doing it.  To execute this command from
     the Business shell, bsh(1), or the C shell, csh(1), braces
     must be preceded with a backslash (\).

          ls $1 | xargs -i -t mv $1/{} $2/{}

     The following command combines the output of the
     parenthesized commands onto one line, which is then echoed
     to the end-of-file log:

          (logname; date; echo $0 $*) | xargs >>log

     The user is asked which files in the current directory are
     to be archived.  They are archived into the file named arch
     one at a time as in command line 1., or many at a time as in
     command line 2.

     1.    ls | xargs -p -l ar r arch
     2.    ls | xargs -p -l | xargs ar r arch

     The following command executes diff(1) with successive pairs
     of arguments originally typed as shell arguments:

          echo $* | xargs -n2 diff
