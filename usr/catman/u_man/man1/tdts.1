NAME
     tdts - Invokes the transaction data transfer server

SYNOPSIS
     tdts -s

DESCRIPTION
   Purpose
     The tdts command invokes the transaction data transfer
     server parent daemon running on the System 1500.

   Option
     -s slot_num The server daemon (tdts) is started only on the
     chassis slot specified. The slot_num is a decimal number in
     the range 0 through 15. If no slot number is specified a
     server daemon is started for each CCB that has a LAN option
     board specified.

   Discussion
     The tdts daemon is called by the tdts command in the
     /etc/download file when you enter multiuser mode. One tdts
     daemon is started for each existing communications carrier
     board (CCB) with a local area network (LAN) option board.
     The initial connection request for each communications
     session is sent to the parent daemon through a well known
     socket. When a session is granted by the parent, a tdts
     child is forked to handle exclusively through an ephemeral
     socket the remaining communications for that session.  Each
     session can have a different time-out value assigned by the
     requester. The default time-out value is 30 seconds.

     The tdts daemon responds to the transaction data transfer
     (TDT) requests received on a Xerox Network Systems(TM) (XNS)
     well known socket (socket number hex 04B1). The TDT protocol
     is a simple file transfer protocol based upon the XNS Packet
     Exchange Protocol (PEP). This protocol is used by the netcp
     and the netexec to move files or directories between the
     local system and a remote system (System 1500 or Business
     System). To obtain a detailed specification of the TDT
     protocol, write to:

     You need the following hardware, software, and installation
     updates when you use tdts.

     + Hardware requirements - The netcp, netexec, and tdts
       program will work over a LAN or a wide area network (WAN)
       using V.35 modems and leased communications lines.
       Depending on the type of network used, the following
       hardware is required.

       For the LAN, the System 1500 requires the 802.3/Ethernet
       LAN option board and the Ethernet adapter board. If your
       system has a network terminal concentrator (NTC), the
       System 1500 is configured with the required option and
       Ethernet adapter boards. The LAN configuration must be
       used to connect to the Business Systems.

       For the WAN, the System 1500 requires the 802.3/Ethernet
       LAN option board and the V.35 adapter board. The System
       1500 supports speeds up to 1 megabit per second.
       Typically, V.35 modems operate in the range of 56 to 64
       kilobits per second. Modems with speeds greater than 64
       kilobits per second or modem eliminators can be used with
       the System 1500, but the V.35 configuration is supported
       only between System 1500s.

     + Software requirements - Distributed Network Input/Output
       (DNIO) release 2.1.1 or later must be installed on the
       Business System.

       The site name defined in the /etc/sitename file is used by
       tdts to identify the local site on the network.	Replace
       the dummy sitename entry in the /etc/sitename file with
       the desired site name. A site name is a 1- to 8-character
       alphanumeric string, with no special characters allowed.
       This site name is also used by uucp and by the DNIO/1500
       upgrade software. The next time (init 2) is executed, the
       tdts daemon is started and netcp/netexec sessions
       accepted.
