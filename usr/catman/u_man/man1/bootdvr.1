BOOTDVR(1T)                                           BOOTDVR(1T)

NAME
     bootdvr - Boots the system

SYNOPSIS
     bootdvr

DESCRIPTION
     The bootdvr command causes a complete and immediate system
     reset.  The system reacts as if four breaks were entered via
     the console.  It is strongly recommended that shutdown be
     run before executing bootdvr.

     The command can be executed from any terminal and must be
     executed by the super-user.

SEE ALSO
     shutdown(1M), shutdown(2), sysboot(1T).
