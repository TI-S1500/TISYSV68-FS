BATCH(1)						 BATCH(1)

NAME
     batch - Executes commands at a later time

SYNOPSIS
     batch

DESCRIPTION
   Purpose
     The batch command reads commands from standard input to be
     executed at a later time.

   Discussion
     Standard output and standard error output are mailed to the
     user unless they are redirected elsewhere.  The shell
     environment variables, current directory, file size limits,
     and permissions (read, write, and execute) for owner, group,
     and others are retained when the commands are executed.
     Open file descriptors, traps, and priority are lost.

     The batch command submits a batch job.  Processes from batch
     go into a different queue from that of at(1).  With at you
     specify when commands are to be executed.	Commands queued
     with batch are executed when system load level permits.  The
     batch command writes the job number and schedule time to
     standard error.

EXAMPLES
     The following example can be used at a terminal (the
     notation <CTRL-D> means to press and hold the CTRL key and
     press the d key):

	  batch
	  cp dir1/* dir2
	  <CTRL-D>

     The following example, which demonstrates redirecting
     standard error to a pipe, is useful in shell procedures (the
     sequence of output redirection specifications is
     significant):

	  batch <<!
	  cp dir1/* dir2 ; ls -l dir2 | mail loginid
	  !


PROMPTS
   Command File Name:
     Enter the command file name to be input to the shell.

FILES
     /usr/lib/cron		Main cron directory
     /usr/lib/cron/at.allow	List of allowed users
     /usr/lib/cron/at.deny	List of denied users
     /usr/lib/cron/queue	Scheduling information
     /usr/spool/cron/atjobs	Directory for spooled jobs

SEE ALSO
     at(1), cron(1M), kill(1), mail(1), nice(1), ps(1), sh(1).

DIAGNOSTICS
     The utility displays messages about various syntax errors.

NOTES
     Commands that try to determine the tty name of standard
     input (such as write(1)) may exhibit strange behavior when
     run by batch.
