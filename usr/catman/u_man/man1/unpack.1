UNPACK(1)                                               UNPACK(1)

NAME
     unpack - Expands packed files

SYNOPSIS
     unpack files

DESCRIPTION
   Purpose
     The unpack command expands files created by pack(1).

   Discussion
     For each file specified in the command, a search is made for
     file.z (or just file, if file ends in .z).  If this file
     appears to be a packed file, it is replaced by its expanded
     version.  The new file has the .z suffix stripped from its
     name, and it has the same access modes, access and
     modification dates, and owner as the packed file.

     The unpack command returns a value for the number of files
     it was unable to unpack.  Failure might occur for any of the
     following reasons:

     + The file name (exclusive of the .z ) has more than 12
       characters.

     + The file cannot be opened.

     + The file does not appear to be the output of pack.

     + A file with the unpacked name already exists.

     + The unpacked file cannot be created.

EXAMPLE
     The following example displays to the standard input a
     packed file named name.z:

          unpack name.z

PROMPTS
   Input File Name(s):
     Enter the name of the files to be expanded.
