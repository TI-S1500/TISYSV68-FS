NEWGRP(1)                                               NEWGRP(1)

NAME
     newgrp - Logs in to a new group

SYNOPSIS
     newgrp [-[group]]

DESCRIPTION
   Purpose
     The newgrp command changes the group identification of its
     caller.  The same person remains logged in and the current
     directory is unchanged, but calculations of access
     permissions to files are performed with respect to the new
     group ID.

     A password is demanded if the group has a password and the
     user does not or if the group has a password and the user is
     not listed in /etc/group as being a member of that group.

   Arguments
     The newgrp command without an argument changes the group
     identification to the group in the password file. In effect,
     it changes the group identification back to the caller's
     original group.

     An initial - argument causes the environment to be changed
     to the one that would be expected if the user actually
     logged in again.

EXAMPLE
     The following example changes the user's group ID to that of
     the group named mygroup.

          newgrp mygroup

PROMPTS
   New Group Name:
     Enter the name of the new group.

   Change Environment:
     The initial value is no.  Enter yes to change the
     environment to the environment expected if the user actually
     logged in again.

FILES
     /etc/group
     /etc/passwd

SEE ALSO
     login(1), group(4).

NOTES
     There is no convenient way to enter a password into
     /etc/group.

     The Bourne (sh) shell traps newgrp as an internal command.
     To get the full functionality described here, execute newgrp
     directly out of /bin/newgrp.
