LPMOVE(1M)                                             LPMOVE(1M)

NAME
     lpmove - Moves requests

SYNOPSIS
     /usr/lib/lpmove requests dest
     /usr/lib/lpmove dest1 dest2

DESCRIPTION
     lpmove moves requests that were queued by lp (1) between LP
     destinations. The first form of the lpmove command shown
     above (under Synopsis) moves the named requests to the LP
     destination dest. requests are request IDs as returned by
     lp(1). The second form of the lpmove command moves all
     requests for destination dest1 to destination dest2; lp(1)
     will then reject any new requests for dest1.

     Note that when moving request, lpmove never checks the
     acceptance status (see accept(1M)) of the new destination.
     Also, the request IDs of the moved request are not changed,
     so that users can still find their requests. The lpmove
     command will not move requests that have options (content
     type, form required, and so on) that cannot be handled by
     the new destination.

     If a request was originally queued for a class or the
     special destination any, its destination will be changed to
     new-destination. A request thus affected will be printable
     only on new-destination and not on other members of the
     class or other acceptable printers if the original
     destination was any.

NOTE
     By default, the directory /usr/spool/lp is used to hold all
     the files used by the LP print service. This can be changed
     by setting the SPOOLDIR environment variable to another
     directory before running lpsched. If you do this, you should
     populate the directory with the same files and directories
     found under /usr/spool/lp; the LP print service will not
     automatically create them. Also, the SPOOLDIR variable must
     the be set before any of the other LP print service commands
     are run.

FILES
     /usr/spool/lp/*
