PWCONV(1M)                                             PWCONV(1M)

NAME
     pwconv - Installs and updates /etc/shadow with information
     from /etc/passwd

SYNOPSIS
     pwconv

DESCRIPTION
     The pwconv command creates and updates /etc/shadow with
     information from /etc/passwd.

     If the /etc/shadow file does not exist, this command will
     create /etc/shadow with information from /etc/passwd.  The
     command populates /etc/shadow with the user's login name,
     password, and password aging information.  If password aging
     information does not exist in /etc/passwd for a given user,
     none will be added to /etc/shadow.  However, the "last
     changed" information will always be updated.

     If the /etc/shadow file does exist, the following tasks will
     be performed:

          Entries that are in the /etc/passwd file and not in the
          /etc/shadow file will be added to the /etc/shadow file.

          Entries that are in the /etc/shadow file and not in the
          /etc/passwd file will be removed from /etc/shadow.

          Password attributes (e.g., password and aging
          information) that exist in an /etc/passwd entry will be
          moved to the corresponding entry in /etc/shadow.

     The pwconv program is a privileged system command that
     cannot be executed by ordinary users.
