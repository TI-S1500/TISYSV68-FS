SCCSDIFF(1)                                           SCCSDIFF(1)

NAME
     sccsdiff - Compares two versions of an SCCS file

SYNOPSIS
     sccsdiff -prs files

DESCRIPTION
   Purpose
     The sccsdiff command compares two versions of an SCCS file
     and generates the differences between the two versions.

     Any number of SCCS files can be specified in this command,
     but arguments apply to all files.

   Options
     -p   Pipe output for each file through pr(1).

     -rSID1 and -rSID2
          SID1 and SID2 specify the deltas of an SCCS file that
          are to be compared.  Versions are passed to bdiff(1) in
          the order given.

     -sn  n is the file segment size that bdiff will pass to
          diff(1).  This is useful when diff fails due to a high
          system load.

EXAMPLE
     The following command reports the difference between
     versions 1.2 and 1.3 of the SCCS file named s.file1:

          sccsdiff -r1.2 -r1.3 s.file1

PROMPTS

     through the pr command.
