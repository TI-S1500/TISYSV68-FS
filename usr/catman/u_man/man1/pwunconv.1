NAME
     pwunconv - Converts from a two- to a one-password file
     scheme

SYNOPSIS
     pwunconv

DESCRIPTION
     pwunconv converts the TI System V two-password file scheme
     (/etc/passwd and /etc/shadow) in to a one-password file
     scheme (/etc/passwd).  It updates /etc/passwd with password
     information from /etc/shadow.  If aging information is
     present in /etc/shadow, the password aging information in
     /etc/passwd is also updated.

     The total size of a login entry for the password file is
     limited to a maximum of 511 bytes.

FILES
     /etc/passwd, /etc/shadow, /etc/opasswd, /etc/oshadow
