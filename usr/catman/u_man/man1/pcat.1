PCAT(1)                                                   PCAT(1)

NAME
     pcat - Expands packed files

SYNOPSIS
     pcat files

DESCRIPTION
   Purpose
     The pcat command restores packed files (see pack(1)) to
     their original form.

   Discussion
     The pcat command does for packed files what cat(1) does for
     ordinary files.  The specified files are unpacked and
     written to the standard output.  The pcat command returns
     the number of files it was unable to unpack.

     Failure might occur if:

          a. The file name (exclusive of the .z ) has more than
             12 characters

          b. The file cannot be opened

          c. The file does not appear to be the output of pack

EXAMPLES
     The following example displays to the standard input a
     packed file named name.z:

          pcat name.z

     The following example makes an unpacked copy named nnn of a
     packed file named name.z without destroying name.z:

          pcat name > nnn

PROMPTS
   Input File Name(s):
     Enter the name of the files to be expanded.

   Output File Name:
     Response to this prompt is optional.  Enter a file name to
     receive the output of the command.

SEE ALSO
     cat(1), pack(1), unpack(1).
