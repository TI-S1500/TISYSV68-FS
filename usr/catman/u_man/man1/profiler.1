NAME
     profiler - Collects and reports operating system activity
     data

SYNOPSIS
     prfdc file [ period  [ off_hour ]]
     prfld [namelist]
     prfpr file [ cutoff [ namelist ]]
     prfsnap file
     prfstat on
     prfstat off

DESCRIPTION
   Purpose
     These commands allow an activity study of the operating
     system.

   prfdc
     The prfdc command performs the data collection function of
     the operating system profiler by copying the current value
     of all the text address counters to a file where the data
     can be analyzed.  The counters are stored in file every
     period minutes, and sampling discontinues at off_hour (valid
     values for off_hour are 0 through 24).

   prfld
     The prfld command initializes the recording mechanism in the
     system.  It generates a table containing the starting
     address of each system subroutine found in namelist.

   prfpr
     The prfpr command formats the data collected by prfdc or
     prfsnap.  Each text address is converted to the nearest text
     symbol (as found in namelist) and is printed if the percent
     activity for that range is greater than cutoff.

   prfsnap
     The prfsnap command collects data at the time of invocation
     only, appending the counter values to file.

   prfstat
     The prfstat command enables (/etc/prfstat on) or disables
     (/etc/prfstat off) the sampling mechanism.  Profiler
     overhead is less than 1% as calculated for 500 text
     addresses.  The prfstat command also reveals the number of
     text addresses being measured.
