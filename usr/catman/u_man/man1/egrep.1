EGREP(1)                                                 EGREP(1)

NAME
     egrep - Searches a file for a pattern

SYNOPSIS
     egrep -bcfilnve expression files

DESCRIPTION
   Purpose
     The egrep command searches the input files (standard input
     is the default) for lines matching a full regular
     expression.  See Regular Expressions in ed(1) for a
     definition of regular expressions.

     The egrep command cannot find a string in an executable
     file.

   Options
     -b        Each line is preceded by the block number on which
               it was found.  This is sometimes useful in
               locating disk block numbers by context (blocks are
               1024 bytes long).

     -c        Only a count of matching lines is printed.

     -e        Finds an expression that begins with a -.  If used
               with another, the e option must be the last option
               specified.

     -f file   The regular expression is taken from the file.

     -i        Ignores uppercase and lowercase distinction during
               comparison.

     -l        Only the names of files with matching lines are
               listed (once), separated by newlines.

     -n        Each line is preceded by its relative line number
               in the file.

     -v        All lines except those matching are printed.

   Discussion
     Normally, each line found is copied to the standard output.
     The egrep command uses a fast deterministic algorithm that
     sometimes needs exponential space.  In all cases, the file
     name is output if there is more than one input file.  Be
     careful when using the characters $, *, [, ^, |, (, ), and \
     in expression, because they are also meaningful to the
     shell.  It is safest to enclose the entire expression
     argument in single quotes '....'.

     The order of precedence of operators is [], then *?+, then
     concatenation, then | and newline.

     The egrep command accepts regular expressions as in ed(1),
     except for \( and \), with the addition of:

     1. A regular expression followed by + matches one or more
        occurrences of the regular expression.

     2. A regular expression followed by ? matches 0 or 1
        occurrences of the regular expression.

     3. Two regular expressions separated by | or by a newline
        match strings that are matched by either.

     4. A regular expression may be enclosed in parentheses ()
        for grouping.

PROMPTS
   Input File Name(s):
     Enter one or more names of files to process.

   Output File Name:
     Enter the name of the file to receive the command output.

   Print All But Matching Lines:
     The initial value is no.  Enter yes to print all lines in
     the input file except those that match the pattern.

   Find an Expression Beginning With '-':
     The initial value is no.  Enter yes to find all expressions
     beginning with -.

   Count Matching Lines:
     The initial value is no.  Enter yes to print only a count of
     the matching lines.

   Ignore Upper/Lower Case:
     The initial value is no.  Enter yes to ignore uppercase and
     lowercase distinction.

   File Names Only:
     The initial value is no.  Enter yes to print only the names
     of the files that contain matching lines.

   Print File Line Numbers:
     The initial value is no.  Enter yes to print the number of
     the line that contains a matching pattern.

   Print Block Numbers:
     The initial value is no.  Enter yes to print the block
     number of the line that contains a matching pattern.

   Expression:
     Enter the expression to match. Expression should not be in
     quotes.  If the expression is one beginning with -, it
     should be entered as such.

   File Containing Pattern:
     Enter the name of a file that contains the pattern to match.

SEE ALSO
     ed(1), fgrep(1), grep(1) sed(1), sh(1).

DIAGNOSTICS
     Exit status is 0 if any matches are found, 1 if none, 2 for
     syntax errors or inaccessible files (even if matches were
     found).

NOTES
     Lines are limited to 256 characters; longer lines are
     truncated.

     The egrep command does not recognize ranges, such as [a-z],
     in character classes.
