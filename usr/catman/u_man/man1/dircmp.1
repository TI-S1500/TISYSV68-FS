DIRCMP(1)                                               DIRCMP(1)

NAME
     dircmp - Compares directories

SYNOPSIS
     dircmp -d -s dir1 dir2

DESCRIPTION
   Purpose
     The dircmp command examines dir1 and dir2 and generates
     various tabulated information about the contents of the
     directories.

   Options
     Listings of files that are unique to each directory are
     generated for all the options.  If no option is entered, a
     list is output indicating whether the file names common to
     both directories have the same contents.

     -d   Compares the contents of files with the same name in
          both directories.  The output is a list reporting what
          must be changed in the two files to bring them into
          agreement.  The list format is described in diff(1).

     -s   Suppresses messages about identical files.

EXAMPLE

     in dir1 and dir2 with the same file name. The command output
     is a list that describes what lines must be changed to make
     the files identical.
