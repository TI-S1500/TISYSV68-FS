MTCRESET(1T)					     MTCRESET(1T)

NAME
     mtcreset - Forces a download of multidrop terminal
     concentrators

SYNOPSIS
     mtcreset -Rps [mtcnames]

DESCRIPTION
   Function
     The mtcreset command forces the specified multidrop terminal
     concentrators (MTCs) to enter the download mode.  When the
     terminal concentrator is running in the RAM downloaded code,
     this command has the same effect as physically pushing the
     ATTN button on the MTC once.

     Only the super-user is allowed to issue this command.

   Options
     -R     Resets all the MTCs defined in the MTC definition
	    file, /etc/mtctab.	The utility scans the MTC
	    information table kept by the MTC download process
	    and resets each MTC.

     -p port
	    Resets all the MTCs defined on this CCB option port.
	    This option is only valid when entered along with the
	    -s option.

     -s slot
	    Resets all the MTCs defined on this CCB slot.

   Arguments
     mtcnames
	    An MTC global name or a list of MTC global names as
	    specified in the MTC definition file, /etc/mtctab.

EXAMPLES
     The following are example command lines for the mtcreset
     command:

	  mtcreset payroll mtc0
	  mtcreset -R

DIAGNOSTICS
     One of the following messages is displayed for each specified MTC upon
     normal mtcreset completion:

     mtcname is reset
		      Indicates that the specified MTC is reset
		      and has entered the download mode.  The
		      download LEDs on the MTC will be turned on.

     Unable to reset mtcname
		      Indicates that the specified MTC did not
		      reset.  The MTC might be in an unknown
		      state.  Further investigation is required.
