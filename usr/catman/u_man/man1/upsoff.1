UPSOFF(1T)                                             UPSOFF(1T)

NAME
     upsoff - Stops the powerfail shutdown sequence

SYNOPSIS
     upsoff

DESCRIPTION
   Discussion
     The upsoff command sets the system powerfail indicator to
     nonpowerfail mode. If /etc/shutdown has been started and is
     still within its grace period, the system shutdown will be
     aborted. If the powerfail grace period in /etc/shutdown has
     already expired when this command is run, the system
     shutdown process will continue. When the shutdown process
     has completed, it will monitor the system's powerfail
     indicator waiting for it to go to into a nonpowerfail mode.
     When this occurs, a system reset will occur.

     By waiting for nonpowerfail mode and performing a system
     reset, reboot is postponed until wall power has been
     restored and the UPS batteries can be recharged.
