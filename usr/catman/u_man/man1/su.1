SU(1)                                                       SU(1)

NAME
     su - Changes user identity to super-user or another user

SYNOPSIS
     su [-] [name[arguments]]

DESCRIPTION
   Purpose
     The su command allows one user to take the identity of
     another user without logging off.

   Discussion
     The default user name is root (the super-user name).

     To use su, the appropriate password must be supplied if one
     exists (unless one is already super-user).  If the password
     is correct, su will execute a new shell with the user ID set
     to that of the specified user.  To restore normal user ID
     privileges, type an EOF (CTRL-d) to the new shell.

     Any additional arguments are passed to the shell, permitting
     the super-user to run shell procedures with restricted
     privileges (an arg of the form -c string executes string via
     the shell).  When additional arguments are passed, /bin/sh
     is always used.  When no additional arguments are passed, su
     uses the shell specified in the password file.

     An initial - flag causes the environment to be changed to
     the one that would be expected if the user actually logged
     in again except that the variable TERM is not set.  That is,
     the former environment is not passed to the new shell.  This
     is done by invoking the shell with an arg0 of -su, causing
     the .profile in the home directory of the new user ID to be
     executed, provided the user's default shell is sh(1).  If an
     initial - flag is not used, the environment is passed along
     with the possible exception of $PATH, which is set to
     /bin:/etc:/usr/bin for root.  Note that the /etc/profile
     file can check arg0 for -sh or -su to determine how it was
     invoked.

EXAMPLES
     To become user bin while retaining your previously exported
     environment, execute the following command:

          su bin

     To become user bin but change the environment to what would
     be expected if bin actually logged in, execute the
     following:

          su - bin

     To execute command with the temporary environment and
     permissions of user bin, type:

          su - bin -c command args

PROMPTS
   User's Name:
     Initial value is root.  Enter the login name.

   Change Environment:
     The initial value is no.  Enter yes to change the
     environment to the one that would be expected if the user
     actually logged in again.

   Command and Arguments:
     Enter the command to execute under the specified login name,
     if any.
