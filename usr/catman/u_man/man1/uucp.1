UUCP(1C)                                                 UUCP(1C)

NAME
     uucp - Copies files from UNIX system to UNIX system

SYNOPSIS
     uucp -cCdefjmnr source-files destination-file

DESCRIPTION
   Purpose
     The uucp command copies files named by the source-file
     arguments to the files named by the destination-file
     argument.

   Options
     -c   Does not queue the source file to /usr/spool/uucp, the
          spool directory.  This is the default.

     -C   Copies the source file to the spool directory.

     -d   Makes all necessary directories for the file copy
          (default).

     -esys
          Sends the uucp command to system sys to be executed
          there.  (This option is successful only if the remote
          machine allows the uucp command to be executed by
          /usr/lib/uucp/uuxqt.)

     -f   Does not make intermediate directories for the file
          copy.

     -j   Outputs the job identification ASCII string on the
          standard output.  This job identification can be used
          by uustat(1C) to obtain the status of or to terminate a
          job.

     -mfile
          Reports status of the transfer in file. If file is
          omitted, uucp sends mail to the requester when the copy
          is completed.

     -nuser
          Notifies user on the remote system that a file was
          sent.

     -r   Queues job but does not start the file transfer
          process.  By default, a file transfer process is
          started each time uucp is evoked.

   Discussion
     A file name may be a path name, or may have the following
     form:

     system-name!path-name

     The system-name is taken from a list of system names
     recognizable to uucp.  The system-name can also be a list of
     names in the following form:

     system-name!system-name!...!system-name!path-name

     In this case, an attempt is made to send the file via the
     specified route, and only to a destination in PUBDIR (as
     explained in this section).  The user must ensure that
     intermediate nodes in the route are willing to forward
     information.

     The shell metacharacters ?, *, and [...] appearing in path-
     name are expanded on the appropriate system.

     Path names may be one of the following:

     + A full path name

     + A path name preceded by ~user, where ~user is a login name
       on the specified system and is replaced by that user's
       login directory

     + A path name preceded by ~/user where user is a login name
       on the specified system and is replaced by that user's
       directory under PUBDIR

     + Anything else is prefixed by the current directory.

     If the result is an erroneous path name for the remote
     system, the copy fails.  If the destination-file is a
     directory, the last part of the source-file name is used.

     If a simple ~user destination is inaccessible to uucp, data
     is copied to a spool directory and the user is notified by
     mail(1).

     The uucp command preserves execute permissions across the
     transmission and gives 0666 read and write permissions.  See
     chmod (2).

     The ! must be preceded by a \ if your shell is the TI
     Business shell or the C shell.

EXAMPLE
     The following example sends the file named afile from the
     local TI System V system to the system named park, saves
     afile as /usr/home/run/bfile, and notifies the user named
     sluggo that the file is sent.

          uucp -nsluggo afile park!/usr/home/run/bfile

PROMPTS
   Source System Path Name:
     Enter the path name of the file to send. The path name can
     be preceded by a system name.

   Destination System Path Name:
     Enter the path name of the destination. The path name can be
     preceded by a system name.

   Copy the Source File to Spool
     Initial value is no.  If you enter yes, the input file is
     copied into the spooler directory.

   System to Execute UUCP Command:
     Optional. Enter the system name where the uucp command will
     be executed.

   Make Intermediate Directories:
     Initial value is yes.  If you enter no, the intermediate
     directories are not created.

   Suppress Output of Job Number:
     Initial value is no.  If you enter yes, the job number is
     not written to the standard output.

   Status File Name:
     Optional. Enter the name of the file to receive the status
     reports.

   User to Notify on Remote:
     Optional. Enter a remote user name.  This user is notified
     on the remote system that a file has been sent.

   Queue Jobs But Don't Start Transfer:
     Initial value is no.  If yes is entered the job will be
     queued but will not be executed.

     In responding to prompts, keep in mind the following:

     + A path name can be preceded by ~ or ~/user.

     + You can enter system name!system name!...system
       name!pathname.

     + You can send more than one source path name at a time.

     + If you have problems, check the files under /usr/lib/uucp
       and delete any /usr/spool/uucp/LCK..(tty-device) files.

FILES
     /usr/spool/uucp        Spool directory
     /usr/spool/uucppublic  Public directory for receiving and
                            sending (PUBDIR)
     /usr/lib/uucp/*        Other data and program files

SEE ALSO
     mail(1), uulog(1C), uuname(1C), uux(1C).

NOTES
     The domain of remotely accessible files can (and for obvious
     security reasons, usually should) be severely restricted.

     If you are unable to retrieve files by path name ask an
     authorized person on the remote system to send the files to
     you.

     As distributed, the remotely accessible files are those
     whose names begin with /usr/spool/uucppublic (equivalent to
     ~uucp or just ~).

     All files received by uucp are then owned by uucp.

     The -m option works only for sending files or receiving a
     single file.  Receiving multiple files specified by the
     special shell characters ?, *, and [...] does not activate
     the -m option.
