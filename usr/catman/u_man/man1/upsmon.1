UPSMON(1T)                                             UPSMON(1T)

NAME
     upsmon - Monitors the UPS state

SYNOPSIS
     upsmon

DESCRIPTION
   Discussion
     The upsmon command monitors the state of the UPS and stops
     the powerful shutdown process (like upsoff(1T)).  upsmon is
     invoked from /etc/shutdown just before the powerfail grace
     period.  Upon expiration of the grace period, if upsmon has
     set the system powerfail indicator off, shutdown will abort
     the powerfail process.

NOTES
     upsmon assumes that a powerfail condition exists before it
     is started.  When it detects the UPS is no longer online, it
     sets the system powerfail indicator off, turns off forced
     write mode, and exits.

     upsmon functions only on systems with built-in UPS support
     hardware.  The functionality provided by upsmon is provided
     by the upswait(1T) command on systems that do not have UPS
     support hardware.

     upsmon will automatically go into background operation so
     the user need not manually place upsmon in background.
