SUM(1)                                                     SUM(1)

NAME
     sum - Prints checksum and block count of a file

SYNOPSIS
     sum -r files

DESCRIPTION
   Purpose
     The sum command calculates and prints a 16-bit checksum for
     the named files, and also prints the number of blocks in the
     files.  It is typically used to look for bad spots, or to
     validate a file communicated over a transmission line.  If
     no file is given, sum uses the standard input.

   Option
     -r   Causes an alternate algorithm to be used in computing
          the checksum.

EXAMPLES
     To print the checksum and block count of a file named
     tempest, type the following command:

          sum tempest

     The result might look like as follows:

          46955 4 tempest

     To print the checksum (computed with an alternate algorithm)
     and block count of the same file tempest, type the following
     command:

          sum -r tempest

     The result might look like this as follows:

          28804     4 tempest

PROMPTS
   Input File Name:
     Enter the name of the file to process.

   Use an Alternate Algorithm:
     The initial value is no.  Enter yes to cause an alternate
     algorithm to be used in computing the checksum.

SEE ALSO
     wc(1).

DIAGNOSTICS
     A ``Read error'' message is indistinguishable from an end-
     of-file marker on most devices. Check the block count.
