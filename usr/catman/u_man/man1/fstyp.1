FSTYP(1M)                                               FSTYP(1M)

NAME
     fstyp - Determines the file system identifier

SYNOPSIS
     fstyp special

DESCRIPTION
     fstyp allows the user to determine the file system
     identifier of mounted or unmounted file systems using
     heuristic programs. The file system type is required by
     mount(2) and sometimes by mount(1M) to mount file systems of
     different types.

     The directory /etc/fstyp.d contains a program for each file
     system type to be checked; each of these programs applies
     some appropriate heuristic to determine whether the supplied
     special file is of the type for which it checks.  If it is,
     the program prints on standard output the usual file system
     identifier for that type and exits with a return code of 0;
     otherwise, it prints error messages on standard error and
     exits with a nonzero return code.  fstyp runs the programs
     in /etc/fstyp.d in alphabetical order, passing special as an
     argument; if any program succeeds, its file system type
     identifier is printed and fstyp exits immediately. If no
     program succeeds, fstyp prints Unknown_fstyp to indicate
     failure. If you wish to get a more informative message about
     why each program in fstyp.d failed, you can run each program
     in the fstyp.d directory giving special as a parameter. The
     fstyp command will only print Unknown_fstyp and no other
     error.

WARNING
     The use of heuristics implies that the result of fstyp is
     not guaranteed to be accurate.
