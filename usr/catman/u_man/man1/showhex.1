SHOWHEX(1T)                                           SHOWHEX(1T)

NAME
     showhex - Shows and edits files in hex and ASCII format

SYNOPSIS
     showhex file

DESCRIPTION
   Purpose
     The showhex command displays files in hex format only or in
     both hex and ASCII format.  Press e to enter edit mode and
     change characters in the displayed portion of the file.

   Discussion
     The  leftmost column of the display produced by showhex
     consists of decimal integers indicating the number of the
     first byte in each row.  The remainder of the display
     consists of eight columns of hex numbers or five columns of
     hex numbers and one column of ASCII text.  Press x to toggle
     between hex-only and hex-ASCII format.

     No cursor appears when the file is displayed.  During edit,
     the cursor does not land in gaps between columns.  In edit
     mode, the utility accepts only hex characters (0-9 and a-f)
     while the cursor is in the hex portion of the display.  You
     can enter either uppercase or lowercase hex characters.
     Only the arrow keys move the cursor in edit mode.  The other
     keys, including backspace and control characters, are
     interpreted as new characters to put into the file.

     You must edit files one page at a time.  When showhex enters
     edit mode, the cursor appears approximately in the center of
     the display.  If you abort the edit and do not write the
     changes to disk (that is, you do not press the w key), a
     buffer retains the changes.  You can flush the buffer by
     paging several pages toward the bottom of the file.

   Commands
     After you execute showhex, the following commands are
     available:

     q or Q            Exits to the shell or exit the edit mode
                       back to display mode

     ?                 Shows a help screen

     Return            Returns to the previous display

     j or down arrow   Scrolls down (toward the end of the file)
                       one line

     k or up arrow     Scrolls up one line

     h or left arrow   Scrolls left one character

     l or right arrow  Scrolls right one character

     F1 or J           Scrolls down 24 lines (one page toward the
                       end of the file)

     F2 or K           Scrolls up 24 lines

     F3 or H           Scrolls left 4 characters

     F4 or L           Scrolls right 4 characters

     x                 Toggles between 5 and 8 words per line

     e                 Enters edit mode

     w                 Writes changes to disk in edit mode

   Edit Mode
     The showhex command has a very simple edit mode; it will
     substitute new characters for existing ones.  Inserting or
     deleting characters is not supported. Press the e key to
     enter the edit mode.  In edit mode, only the arrow keys will
     move the cursor. All other keys, including the backspace,
     return, line feed, and control characters, are interpreted
     as substitutes for the character that is under the prompt.

     Terminals that do not have arrow keys cannot use the edit
     function.  Function keys whose generated character sequence
     begins with the same character as the arrow keys will be
     ignored.

PROMPT
   File Name:
     Enter the name of the file whose contents you want displayed
     in hexadecimal format.
