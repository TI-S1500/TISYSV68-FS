PR(1)                                                       PR(1)

NAME
     pr - Prints files

SYNOPSIS
     pr +k -k -adefhilmnoprstw files

DESCRIPTION
     The pr command prints the named files on the standard
     output.

   Options
     The options can appear singly or be combined in any order.

     +k    Begins printing with page k (default is 1).

     -k    Produces k-column output (default is 1).  The options
           -e and -i are assumed for multicolumn output.

           Multicolumn output truncates lines if necessary to fit
           the specified number of columns on the screen.  At
           least one blank space is inserted between columns.

     -a    Prints multicolumn output across the page.

     -d    Double-spaces the output.

     -eck  Expands input tabs to character positions k+1, 2*k+1,
           3*k+1, etc.  If k is 0 or is omitted, default tab
           settings at every eighth position are assumed.  Tab
           characters in the input are expanded into the
           appropriate number of spaces.  If c (any non-digit
           character) is given, it is treated as the input tab
           character (default for c is the tab character).

     -f    Uses form-feed character for new pages (default is to
           use a sequence of line-feeds).  Pause before beginning
           the first page if the standard output is associated
           with a terminal.

     -h    Uses the next argument as the header to be printed
           instead of the file name.

     -ick  In output, replaces white space wherever possible by
           inserting tabs to character positions k+1, 2*k+1,
           3*k+1, etc.  If k is 0 or is omitted, default tab
           settings at every eighth position are assumed.  If c
           (any non-digit character) is given, it is treated as
           the output tab character (default for c is the tab
           character).

     -lk   Sets the length of a page to k lines (default is 66).
           Note that the header and the trailer together use a
           total of 10 of the lines.  Do not specify k less than
           10.

     -m    Merges and prints all files simultaneously, one per
           column (overrides the -k, and -a options).

     -nck  Provides k-digit line numbering (default for k is 5).
           The number occupies the first k character positions of
           each column of normal output or each line of -m
           output.  If c (any non-digit character) is given, it
           is appended to the line number to separate it from
           whatever follows (default for c is a tab).

     -ok   Offsets each line by k character positions (default is
           0).  The number of character positions per line is the
           sum of the width and offset.

     -p    Pauses before beginning each page, including the first
           page, if the output is directed to a terminal.  The
           program rings the bell at the terminal and waits for
           the user to press RETURN.

     -r    Prints no diagnostic reports on failure to open files.

     -sc   Separates columns by the single character c instead of
           by the appropriate number of spaces (default for c is
           a tab).

     -t    Prints neither the 5-line identifying header nor the
           5-line trailer normally supplied for each page and
           quits printing after the last line of each file
           without spacing to the end of the page.

     -wk   Sets the width of a line to k character positions
           (default is 72 for equal-width multicolumn output, no
           limit otherwise).

   Discussion
     If file is -, or if no files are specified, the standard
     input is assumed.  By default, the listing is separated into
     pages, each headed by the page number, a date and time, and
     the name of the file.

     By default, columns are of equal width, separated by at
     least one space; lines that do not fit are truncated. If the
     -s option is used, lines are not truncated and columns are
     separated by the separation character.

     If the standard output is associated with a terminal, error
     messages are withheld until pr has completed printing.

EXAMPLES
     The following example formats a C program source file with
     numbered lines and pipes the file to a printer:

          pr -n prog1.c | lp

     The following example prints file1 and file2 as a double-
     spaced, three-column listing headed by "file list":

          pr -3dh "file list" file1 file2

     The following example writes file1 on file2, expanding tabs
     to columns 10, 19, 28, 37, ... :

          pr -e9 -t <file1 >file2
