RSH(1)                                                     RSH(1)

NAME
     rsh - Invokes the restricted Bourne shell

SYNOPSIS
     rsh -acefhiknstuvx args

DESCRIPTION
   Purpose
     The rsh command sets up login names and execution
     environments with capabilities more controlled than those of
     the standard Bourne shell.  The actions of rsh are identical
     to those of sh(1), except that the following are disallowed:
          Changing directory, as described in cd(1)
          Setting the value of $PATH
          Specifying path or command names containing /
          Redirecting output with > and >>

   Options
     See sh(1).

   Discussion
     Shell restrictions are enforced after the .profile file is
     interpreted.

     When a command to be executed is a shell procedure, rsh
     invokes sh to execute the command.  Thus, it is possible to
     provide to the end-user shell procedures that have access to
     the full power of the standard shell, while imposing a
     limited menu of commands.  This scheme assumes that the
     end-user does not have write and execute permissions in the
     same directory.

     The net effect of these rules is that the writer of the
     .profile file has complete control over user actions by
     performing guaranteed setup actions and leaving the user in
     an appropriate directory (probably not the login directory).

     The rsh command is intended to protect the system from
     valid, but potentially destructive commands given by the
     novice user.  It does not reliably safeguard the system from
     a knowledgeable intruder.

     The system administrator can set up a directory of commands
     (the directory /usr/rbin) that can be safely invoked by rsh.
