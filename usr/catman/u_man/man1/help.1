HELP(1)                                                   HELP(1)

NAME
     help - Finds help for SCCS commands

SYNOPSIS
     help arguments

DESCRIPTION
   Purpose
     The help command finds information to explain a message from
     an SCCS command or explain the use of a SCCS command.

     The response of the program is the explanatory information
     related to the argument, if explanatory information exists.

     When all else fails, try the command help stuck.

   Arguments
     Zero or more arguments may be supplied.  If no arguments are
     given, help prompts for one.

     The arguments can be either message numbers (which normally
     appear in parentheses following messages) or command names,
     of one of the following types:

     type 1  Begins with non-numerics, ends in numerics.  The
             non-numeric prefix is usually an abbreviation for
             the program or set of routines which produced the
             message (e.g., ad1, for message 1 from the admin
             command).

     type 2  Does not contain numerics (as a command, such as
             get).

     type 3  Is all numeric.

EXAMPLE
     In the following example, assume that you received an error
     message with the error code de10 when you tried to execute a
     delta command.  For help, enter the following command:

          help de10

     The output of the command is a message explaining that the
     file you tried to process requires a Modification Request
     number.

PROMPTS
   Error Number or Command Name:
     Enter the error number or the command name for which you are
     seeking help.

   Stuck?:
     Initial value is no.  If you enter yes, the command file for
     the help procedure is displayed.  Answering yes to this
     prompt supersedes any response to the first prompt.

FILES
     /usr/lib/help       Directory containing files of message
                         text

     /usr/lib/help/lib/help2
                         Program help calls to search files for
                         the arguments to help.
