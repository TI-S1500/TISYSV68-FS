NETU(1T)						 NETU(1T)

NAME
     netu - Displays the network utilization ratio

SYNOPSIS
     netu -ins

DESCRIPTION
   Purpose
     The netu command reports the average network utilization of
     a local area network (LAN) over the sample period.  The
     ratio is computed by dividing the number of carrier senses
     detected by the number of samples.  This information is
     useful for monitoring normal operation and for
     troubleshooting the network.

   Options
      -i interval
	  Changes the interval between samples in units of 3.2
	  microseconds.  The default interval is 600, (1.92
	  milliseconds).  On the Ethernet, 10 bits require 1
	  microsecond.	The smallest Ethernet packet is 64 bytes
	  or 512 bits, which requires 51 microseconds.

      -n samples
	  Changes the number of samples taken.	The default is
	  2,500 samples.  With the default interval of 1.92
	  milliseconds, the default sample period is 4.8 seconds.

      -s slot
	  Specifies a chassis slot to be examined.  The
	  communications carrier board (CCB) in this slot must
	  have an 802.3/ Ethernet option installed.  With this
	  option only the specified slot is examined.

   Discussion
     The netu command allows the user to examine the utilization
     ratio on the Ethernet network.  If no slot is specified
     (that is, the -s option is not specified) netu examines
     every slot for a CCB LAN board.  If a LAN is found, the
     command reports the utilization of the network and continues
     searching the rest of the slots for more LANs.  Thus, netu
     without the -s option can be used to discover the slots and
     ports of all the 802.3/Ethernet LAN boards on the system.

     Both option ports 0 and 1 of each CCB are examined,
     regardless of whether a slot is specified.

EXAMPLES
     The following command line reports the average network
     utilization of the LAN on chassis slot 3, with a sample
     interval of 320 microseconds:

	  netu -s 3 -i 100

     The following is an example of network information returned
     by netu upon normal completion:

	  NETWORK CARRIER SENSE SATISTICS

	  INTERVAL (sec)= 0.001920
	  NUMBER of SAMPLES= 2500
	  ELAPSED TIME (sec)= 4.8000

DIAGNOSTICS
     The following messages can be displayed by the NETU utility:

	  usage: netu [-i <interval> -n <samples> -s<slot>]
	  Error in retrieving NETU parameters on slot x port y, error = status
	  Specified slot slot out of range of valid slots
	  Error in closing device, slot x port y error = status
	  Unable to open ccb LAN in slot x
	  Unable to open a ccb LAN in any slot

NOTES
     The netu utility decreases the performance of the CCB
     because of the added interrupt and sampling overhead.  With
     the default interval setting the decrease is negligible, but
     with shorter intervals the increased sampling tends to
     decrease the CCB throughput.  If the CCB is using the
     network, the network utilization will also decrease as a
     result of the sampling overhead.  Larger sample intervals
     and longer elapsed times are recommended rather than close
     intervals and short elapsed times.
