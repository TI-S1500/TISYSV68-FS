UMOUNT(1M)                                             UMOUNT(1M)

NAME
     umount - Unmounts file systems and remote resources

SYNOPSIS
     /etc/umount special

DESCRIPTION
     umount announces to the system that the previously mounted
     special is to be made unavailable.  If invoked with
     directory, umount will search /etc/fstab to fill in the
     missing argument(s).

FILES
     /etc/mnttab      Specifies the mount table
     /etc/fstab       Specifies the file system table

SEE ALSO
     fstab(4), fuser(1M), mnttab(4), mount(1M), mount(2),
     setmnt(1M), umount(2).

DIAGNOSTICS
     umount fails if special is not mounted or if it is busy.
     special is busy if it contains an open file or some user's
     working directory.  In such a case, you can use fuser(1M) to
     list and kill processes that are using
     special.
