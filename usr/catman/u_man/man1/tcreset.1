TCRESET(1T)                                           TCRESET(1T)

NAME
     tcreset - Forces a download of network terminal
     concentrators

SYNOPSIS
     tcreset -R [tcnames]

DESCRIPTION
   Function
     The tcreset command forces the specified network terminal
     concentrators (NTCs) to enter the download mode and start
     requesting a download from the host.  When the NTC is
     running in the RAM downloaded code, this command has the
     same effect as physically pushing the Reset button on the
     NTC once.  If the NTC is already waiting for or processing a
     download (that is, in the ROM download code, the download
     LED is on), the download processing is also forced to begin
     again.

     Only the super-user is allowed to issue this command.

   Arguments
     tcnames
            An NTC global name or a list of NTC global names as
            specified in the NTC definition file, /etc/tctab.

   Options
     -R     Resets all the NTCs defined in the NTC definition
            file, /etc/tctab.  The utility scans the NTC
            information table kept by the NTC download process
            and issues a reset request to each NTC.

EXAMPLES
     The following are example command lines for the tcreset
     command:

          tcreset payroll tc0
          tcreset -R

DIAGNOSTICS
     One of the following messages is displayed for each
     specified NTC upon normal tcreset completion:

     tcname is reset  Indicates that the specified NTC responded
                      to the reset request and should have
                      entered the download mode successfully.
                      The download LED on the NTC will be turned
                      on.

     Unable to reset tcname
                      Indicates that the specified NTC did not
                      respond to the reset request.  The NTC
                      might be in an unknown stage.  Further
                      investigation is required.

     The following messages can be displayed by the tcreset
     utility:

     usage: tcreset -[R] [tcname(s)]
     Unable to locate shared memory segment, error =
     Attaching shared memory segment, error =
     Can't open the INET device driver on CCB, err =
     Error from INET device driver on CCB, err =
