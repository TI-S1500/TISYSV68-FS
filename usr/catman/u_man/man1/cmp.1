NAME
     cmp - Compares two files

SYNOPSIS
     cmp -ls file1 file2

DESCRIPTION
   Purpose
     The cmp command compares two files.  If file1 is -, the
     standard input is used.  Under default options, cmp makes no
     comment if the files are the same.  If the files differ, the
     command announces the byte and line number at which the
     first difference occurred.  If one file is an initial
     subsequence of the other (that is, if the second file was
     created by appending data to the first file), that fact is
     noted.

   Options
     The -l and -s options are mutually exclusive.

     -l   Prints the byte number in decimal for each difference,
	  followed by the byte in octal from file 1, then the
	  byte in octal from file 2.

     -s   Prints nothing for differing files.  Returns a 0 if the
	  files were identical and a 1 otherwise.

   Discussion
     For many files, once the files differ, all following
     characters in the file will also differ.  The files are not
     resynchronized by cmp to account for missing or extra
     characters.  The -l option might easily print one line for
     almost every character in the file.

EXAMPLE
     The following example compares filea and fileb but does not
     print anything.

	  cmp -s filea fileb

     To see the results of the command, enter the following
     echo(1) command immediately after the cmp command.  The echo
     command displays a 1 on the standard output if filea and
     fileb differ or a 0 if the files are identical.

	  echo $status

     The previous command is useful within shell scripts.  The
     results of cmp can be tested as follows:

	  if ($status == '0') then
		    .
		    .
		    .

		    cmp -l a b

	  The previous command produces output similar to the
	  following:

	       703  141  146
	       738   56  124
	       739  156  111
	       740  141  111

	  The first 702 bytes of files a and b are identical.
	  The 703rd byte is octal 141 in file a and octal 146 in
	  file b.  The 704th through 737th bytes are identical in
	  files a and b.  The 738th byte is octal 56 in file a
	  and octal 124 in file b.  The 739th byte is octal 156
	  in file a and octal 111 in file b.  The 740th byte is
	  octal 141 in file a and octal 111 in file b.	There are
	  no more bytes to be compared.  One or both of files a
	  and b are 740 bytes long.

PROMPTS
   First File:
     Enter the name of a file to compare.

   Second File:
     Enter the name of a file to be compared with the first file.

   Output File Name:
     Response to this prompt is optional.  Enter a file name to
     receive the output of the command.

   Show Every Byte Difference:
     The initial value is no.  Enter yes to display the byte
     number in decimal and the differing bytes in octal.  Enter
     no to display nothing and return exit codes.

DIAGNOSTICS
     Exit code 0 is returned for identical files, 1 for different
     files, and 2 for an inaccessible or missing argument.
