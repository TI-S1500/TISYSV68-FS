NICE(1)                                                   NICE(1)

NAME
     nice - Runs a command at low priority

SYNOPSIS
     nice - increment command [ arguments ]
     nice + increment command [arguments]

DESCRIPTION
     The nice command executes command with a lower CPU
     scheduling priority.  The increment option is in the range
     1-19.  If increment is not used, an increment of 10 is
     assumed.

     The super-user can run commands with priority higher than
     normal by using a negative increment,
     e.g., - -10.

     The first usage of the Synopsis applies to the Bourne shell.
     The second usage applies to the TI Business shell.

EXAMPLE
     The following two examples run the du command in background
     at low priority.  The first example is executed from the
     Bourne shell; the second from the TI Business shell.

          nice -10 du > du.lst &
          nice +10 du > du.lst &

PROMPTS
   Priority Number (1-19):
     The initial value is 10.  Enter a number from 1 to 19.  The
     priority for the specified command will be lowered by this
     increment.

   Command to be Executed:
     Enter the command, with neither options nor arguments, to
     execute at the specified lower priority.

   Command Arguments:
     Enter the options and arguments for the specified command.

SEE ALSO
     nice(2), nohup(1).

DIAGNOSTICS
     The nice command returns the exit status of the subject
     command.

NOTES
     An increment larger than 19 is equivalent to 19.
