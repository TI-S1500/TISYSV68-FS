NAME
     prs - Prints an SCCS file

SYNOPSIS
     prs -acdelr files

DESCRIPTION
   Purpose
     The prs command prints, on the standard output, parts or all
     of one or more SCCS files (see sccsfile(4)) in a user-
     supplied format.

   Options
     Options for prs, which may appear in any order, consist of
     options and file names.  All the described options apply
     independently to each named file.

     -a 		 Requests printing of information for
			 both removed (i.e., delta type = R; (see
			 rmdel(1)) and existing (i.e., delta type
			 = D) deltas.  If the -a option is not
			 specified, information for existing
			 deltas only is provided.

     -c[date-time]	 The cutoff date-time is in the following
			 form:

			 YY[mm[DD[HH[mm[SS]]]]]

			 Units omitted from the date-time will
			 default to their maximum possible
			 values; that is, -c7502 is equivalent to
			 -c750228235959. Any number of non-
			 numeric characters can separate the
			 various two-digit pieces of the cutoff
			 date in the form -c77/2/2 9:22:25.

     -ddataspec 	 Defines the output data specification.
			 The dataspec is a string consisting of
			 SCCS file data keywords (see Data
			 Keywords) interspersed with optional
			 user-supplied text.

     -e 		 Requests information for all deltas
			 created earlier than and including the
			 delta designated via the -r option or
			 the date given by the -c option.

     -l 		 Requests information for all deltas
			 created later than and including the
			 delta designated via the -r option or
			 the date given by the -c option.

     -rSID		 Specifies the SCCS ID (SID) string of a
			 delta for which information is desired.
			 If no SID is specified, the SID of the
			 most recently created delta is assumed.

   Arguments
     If a directory is named, prs behaves as though each file in
     the directory were specified as a named file, except that
     non-SCCS files (last component of the path name does not
     begin with s.), and unreadable files are silently ignored.
     If a name of - is given, the standard input is read; each
     line of the standard input is taken to be the name of an
     SCCS file or directory to be processed; non-SCCS files and
     unreadable files are silently ignored.

   Data Keywords
     Data keywords specify which parts of an SCCS file are to be
     retrieved and output.  All parts of an SCCS file (see
     sccsfile(4)) have an associated data keyword.  There is no
     limit on the number of times a data keyword can appear in a
     dataspec.

     The information printed by prs consists of:  (1) the user-
     supplied text; and (2) appropriate values (extracted from
     the SCCS file) substituted for  the  recognized data
     keywords in the order of appearance in the dataspec.  The
     format of a data keyword value is either simple (S), in
     which keyword substitution is direct, or multiline (M), in
     which keyword substitution is followed by a carriage return.

     User-supplied text is any text other than recognized data
     keywords.	A tab is specified by \t and carriage
     return/new-line is specified by \n.

EXAMPLES
     The following command:

       prs -d"Users and/or user IDs for UN:" s.file :F: are:\n:

     may produce the following on the standard output:

	  Users and/or user IDs for s.file are:
	  xyz
	  131
	  abc

     The following command:

	  prs -d"Newest delta for pgm D: By :P:" -r s.file :M::
	  :I: Created :

     may produce the following on the standard output:

	  Newest delta for pgm main.c: 3.7 Created 77/12/1 By cas

     As a special case:

	  prs s.file

     may produce the following on the standard output for each
     delta table entry of the D type:

	  D 1.1 77/12/1 00:00:00 cas 1 000000/00000/00000
	  MRs:
	  bl78-12345
	  bl79-54321
	  COMMENTS:
	  this is the comment line for s.file initial delta

     Only the -a option can be used with the preceding special
     case.
