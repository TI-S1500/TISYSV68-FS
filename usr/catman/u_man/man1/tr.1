TR(1)                                                       TR(1)

NAME
     tr - Translates characters

SYNOPSIS
     tr -cds [string1[string2]]

DESCRIPTION
   Purpose
     The tr command copies the standard input to the standard
     output with substitution or deletion of selected characters.
     Input characters found in string1 are mapped into the
     corresponding characters of string2.

   Options
     Any combination of the following options can be used:

     -c   Complements the set of characters in string1 with
          respect to the universe of characters whose ASCII codes
          are 001 through 377 octal.

     -d   Deletes all input characters in string1.

     -s   Squeezes all strings of repeated output characters that
          are in string2 to single characters.

   Arguments
     The following abbreviation conventions can be used to
     introduce ranges of characters or repeated characters into
     the strings:

     [a-z]   Stands for the string of characters whose ASCII
             codes run from character a to character z,
             inclusive.

     [a*n]   Stands for n repetitions of a.  If the first digit
             of n is 0, n is considered octal; otherwise, n is
             taken to be decimal.  A zero or missing n is taken
             to be huge; this facility is useful when the
             required number of occurrences of string2 is
             unknown.


     The escape character \ can be used as in the shell to remove
     special meaning from any character in a string.  In
     addition, \ followed by 1, 2, or 3 octal digits stands for
     the character whose ASCII code is given by those digits.

EXAMPLE
     The following example creates a list of all the words in
     file1 and puts one per line in file2, where a word is taken
     to be a maximal string of alphabetics.  The strings are
     quoted to protect the special characters from interpretation
     by the shell; 012 is the ASCII code for newline.

          tr -cs "[A-Z][a-z]" "[\012*]" <file1 >file2

PROMPTS
   Input File Name:
     Optional. Enter the name of the file to be translated.

   Output File Name:
     Optional.  Enter a file name to receive the output of the
     command.

   String 1:
     Enter first string for mapping.  The expression should not
     be enclosed in quotes.

   String 2:
     Optional. Enter second string for mapping.  The expression
     should not be enclosed in quotes.

   Complement Character Set:
     Initial value is no.  If you enter yes, the set of
     characters in string 1 is complemented with respect to the
     universe of characters whose ASCII codes are 001 through 377
     octal.

   Delete String1 Input Char:
     Initial value is no.  If you enter yes, all characters in
     string 1 are deleted.

   Squeeze Repeated-Single Char:
     Initial value is no.  If you enter yes, all repeated output
     characters that are in string 2 are squeezed into single
     characters.

SEE ALSO
     ascii(5), ed(1), sh(1).

NOTES
     This command cannot handle ASCII NUL in string1 or string2;
     it always deletes NUL from input.
