FUSER(1M)                                               FUSER(1M)

NAME
     fuser - Identifies processes using a file or file structure

SYNOPSIS
     fuser -ku files - [[-ku] files]

DESCRIPTION
   Purpose
     The fuser command uses the specified files as arguments to
     list the process IDs.  For block special devices, all
     processes using any file on that device are listed.

     The process ID is followed by one of the following suffixes:

     c  Means the process is using the file as its current
        directory

     p  Means the process is using the parent of its current
        directory (only when in use by the system)

     r  Means the process is using its root directory

     The process IDs are printed as a single line on the standard
     output and are separated by spaces and terminated with a
     single newline.  All other output is written on standard
     error.

   Options
     -u   Indicates that the login name in parentheses (as well
          as c, p, or r) follows the process ID.

     -k   Indicates that the SIGKILL signal is sent to each
          process.  Only the super-user can terminate another
          user's process.  See kill(2).

     Options can be respecified between groups of files.  The new
     set of options replaces the old set, with a single dash
     canceling any options currently in force.

EXAMPLES
     The command that follows, if executed by the super-user,
     terminates all processes that are preventing the /usr file
     system from being unmounted.  The command lists the process
     ID and login name of each process as it is killed.

          fuser -ku /dev/dsk/sys:usr

     The following command lists the process ID of processes that
     have the password file open:

          fuser -u /etc/passwd

     The following command uses a single command line to execute
     both of the functions shown in the previous examples:

          fuser -ku /dev/dsk/sys:usr -u /etc/passwd

FILES
     /unix        System namelist file
     /dev/kmem    System image file for physical memory
     /dev/mem     System image file for virtual memory

SEE ALSO
     mount(1M), ps(1), kill(2), signal(2).
