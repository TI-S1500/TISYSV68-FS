NAME
     as - Invokes the 68020 assembler

SYNOPSIS
     as -o objfile -dlmsV file

DESCRIPTION
   Purpose
     The as command processes a TI System V 68020 assembler
     source file and produces a Common Object File Format (COFF)
     file for input to the link editor ld(1) or the archive
     utility ar(1).  The as command also produces an optional
     assembly listing file.

   Options
     -o objfile
	  Puts the assembled object file in objfile.  objfile may
	  be a simple file name or path name and is used exactly
	  as specified (nothing is appended).  Without this
	  option, the object output file name is formed by
	  removing the .s suffix, if there is one, from the input
	  file name and appending a .o suffix.

     -d   Executes the linker text dump utility ltxdump(1T) and
	  appends the linker text dump file to the assembly
	  listing.  If the -d option is selected and the -l
	  option is omitted, the assembly listing will consist
	  solely of the linker text dump file.	This option is
	  useful for diagnosing assembler error messages produced
	  by the linker text conversion utility ltxcoff(1T).

     -l   Saves the assembly listing file (indicated by the
	  suffix .lst).  The as command concatenates the
	  individual listing files produced by its constituent
	  utilities into a single assembly listing file.  The
	  listing file name is formed by removing the .s suffix,
	  if there is one, from the input file name and appending
	  a .lst suffix.  Without this option, the assembly
	  listing file is automatically deleted by as.	The
	  symbol report generator qsym is not executed unless the
	  -l option is selected.

     -m   Executes the 68020 assembler macro preprocessor
	  a68m(1T) and includes the a68m error listing file in
	  the assembly listing.  This option is necessary when
	  the input source file contains macro definitions and
	  macro calls.

     -s   Saves intermediate files created during execution of
	  as, including:

	  + The assembler source file (indicated by the suffix
	  .a68) created by the 68020 assembler macro preprocessor
	  a68m(1T).
	  + The ltx file (indicated by the suffix .ltx) and
	  symbol data file (indicated by the suffix .sym) created
	  by the 68020 assembler source processor a68k(1T).

	  Intermediate file names are formed by removing the .s
	  suffix, if there is one, from the input file name and
	  appending the appropriate suffix.  Without this option,
	  intermediate files are automatically deleted by as.

     -V   Writes the assembler version number to standard output.

Discussion
     The as command provides a convenient means for processing
     assembler source via a single command.  The as utility is
     comprised of a sequence of TI System V 68020 assembler
     utilities, each of which accomplishes some individual step
     in the overall assembly process.  The sequence of
     constituent utilities executed by as is defined as follows:

	  Utility      Description		       Options Used

	  a68m(1T)     Assembler macro preprocessor    -l
	  a68k(1T)     Assembler source processor      -bel
	  qsym(1T)     Symbol report generator	       -b
	  ltxcoff(1T)  Linker text conversion utility  (no options)
	  ltxdump(1T)  Linker text dump utility        (no options)

     Note that a68m and ltxdump are optional under as.	Also note
     the options used for individual utilities.  These options
     were selected for execution under as because they are the
     most useful for the general case.	See the individual manual
     pages for each utility for more information.

     Although as should be sufficient for the great majority of
     cases, the constituent assembler utilities are available and
     fully documented for those who wish to use them
     individually.

     The as utility puts all output files in the current
     directory.  The -o option can be used to specify some other
     directory for the assembled object file.

     See the TI System V 68020 Assembler manual for a more
     detailed description of the assembler package.  See the TI
     System V Support Tools Guide for more information about
     COFF.

EXAMPLES
     The following example assembles the input file lt30.s and
     produces the object output file lt30.o.

	  as lt30.s

     The following example assembles the input file lt30.s and
     produces the object output file lt30.o.  The -l option
     directs as to save the assembly listing file in lt30.lst.
     The -m option directs as to process macro definitions and
     calls in lt30.s by invoking a68m.	The -s option directs as
     to save the intermediate files lt30.a68, lt30.ltx, and
     lt30.sym.

	  as -l -m -s lt30.s

     The following example assembles the input file lt30 and
     produces the object output file lt30.obj.

	  as -o lt30.obj lt30

PROMPTS
   Input File Name:
     Response to this prompt is optional.  Enter a file name to
     be assembled.

   Object File Name:
     Response to this prompt is optional.  Enter the name of the
     file to receive the assembled object file.  If no name is
     given, the file name defaults to the input file name and .o
     suffix.

   Execute Linker Text Dump Utility:
     Initial value is no.  If yes is selected, the linker text
     dump utility is executed.

   Save the Assembly Listing File:
     Initial value is no.  If yes is selected, the listing file
     is saved into the file suffixed by .lst.

   Run Pre-processor:
     Initial value is no.  If yes is selected, the 68020 macro
     processor is executed.

   Save Intermediate Files:
     Initial value is no.  If yes is selected, the intermediate
     files created during execution of as are saved.

   Print Assembler Version Number:
     Initial value is no.  If yes is selected, the as version
     number is printed.

DIAGNOSTICS
     Exit status values are as follows:

     + 0 - Completed with no errors, warnings are listed

     + 1 - Completed with error(s)
