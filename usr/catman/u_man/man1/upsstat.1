UPSSTAT(1T)                                           UPSSTAT(1T)

NAME
     upsstat - Reports the status of UPS powerfail state

SYNOPSIS
     upsstat
     upsstat -t
     upsstat -f mode
     upsstat -o mode
     upsstat -O

DESCRIPTION
   Discussion
     If you do not specify an option, upsstat reports the current state of
     the UPS on the standard output. If the UPS is online
     (supplying power from the batteries), upsstat displays a 1.
     If the UPS is not online, upsstat displays a 0.  This method
     is typically used within shell scripts to check the state of
     the UPS.

     If you specify -t, upsstat tests for the presence of UPS
     hardware.  If the system has built-in UPS support (for
     example, the TI 1505), upsstat displays a 1. If the system
     does not have internal UPS support hardware, upsstat
     displays a 0. This method is typically used within shell
     scripts to determine actions to take depending on the type
     of hardware.

     If you specify -f mode, upsstat is used to change the current
     forced write state of the system. You can use this method to
     start and stop forced write mode from the command line or
     from within shell scripts. The mode option in this case is:

     0    Turns forced write mode off

     1    Turns forced write mode on

     If you specify -o mode, upsstat is used to change the action
     of the over temp handler. Normally when overtemp occurs, the
     system enters forced write mode until the overtemp condition
     no longer exists.  The -o option allows you to specify that
     overtemp should be treated as a powerfail condition, and
     start the system powerfail script.

     0    Turns overtemp shutdown mode off

     1    Turns overtemp shutdown mode on

     If you specify -O, upsstat reports the current state of
     overtemp on the standard output. If overtemp is active,
     upsstat displays a 1. If overtemp is not active, upsstat
     displays a 0. This method is typically used within shell
     scripts to check the state of the system overtemp indicator.

NOTES
     Systems with built-in UPS hardware support cannot receive a
     powerfail interrupt from the UPS during an overtemp
     condition and vice versa. It is therefore advisable to
     utilize the shutdown on overtemp capabilities on these
     systems.
