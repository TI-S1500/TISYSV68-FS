NAME
     ff - Lists file names and statistics for a file system

SYNOPSIS
     ff -acfiIlmnpsu special

DESCRIPTION
   Purpose
     The ff command reads the inode list and directories of the
     special file, assuming it to be a file system, and saves
     inode data for files that match the selection criteria.
     Output consists of the path name for each saved inode and
     any other file information requested with print options.

     Output fields are positional.  The output is produced in
     inode order; fields are separated by tabs.  The form of the
     default line produced by ff is as follows:

	  pathname inumber

     With all options except -f enabled, the form of the output
     fields are as follows:

	  pathname inumber size uid

     With the -f option, the form of the output is the form in
     which the frec(1) command expects the input to be. The
     format is as follows:

	  inumber:pathname

   Options
     The argument n in the option descriptions that follow is
     used as an optionally signed  decimal integer, where +n
     means more than n, -n means less than n, and n means exactly
     n.  A day is defined as a 24-hour period.

     -a n	Selects if the inode has been accessed in n days.

     -c n	Selects if the inode has been changed in n days.

     -f 	Generates the output format that can be used for
		frec input.

     -i inode-list
		Generates names for only those inodes specified
		in inode-list.

     -I 	Does not print the inode number after each path
		name.

     -l 	Generates a supplementary list of all path names
		for multiply linked files.

     -m n	Selects if the inode has been modified in n days.

     -n file	Selects if the inode has been modified more
		recently than the argument file.

     -p prefix	Adds the specified prefix to each generated path
		name.  The default prefix is the period-slash
		(./) sequence character.

     -s 	Prints after each path name the file size in
		bytes.

     -u 	Print after each path name the owner's login
		name.

EXAMPLES
     The following command generates a list of the names of all
     files on a specified file system:

	  ff -I /dev/dsk/sys:root

     The following command produces an index of files and
     inumbers that are on the /usr file system and have been
     modified in the last 24 hours:

	  ff -m -1 /dev/dsk/sys:usr > /log/incbackup/usr/tuesday

     The following command provides the path names for inodes 451
     and 76 on the /aux file system:

	  ff -i 451,76 /dev/dsk/data:aux

PROMPTS
   File System Name:
     Enter the name of the file system to process.

   Output File Name:
     Response to this prompt is optional. Enter the name of the
     file to receive the output of the
     command.

   Print I-Node Number:
     The initial value is yes.	If you enter yes or accept the
     initial value, the utility prints the inode number after
     each path name.

   Print File Size:
     The initial value is yes.	If you enter yes or accept the
     initial value, the utility prints the file size in bytes
     after each path name.

   Select Advanced Options:
     The initial value is no.  Enter yes to receive the following
     prompts.

   List Multiply Linked Files:
     The initial value is no.  Enter yes to print a list of all
     path names for multiply linked files.

   Add Prefix to Path Name:
     Enter a prefix to add to each generated path name.

   Days Since Last Access (+,-):" aflag
     The utility prints inode data if the inode has been accessed
     in the specified number of days.

   Days Since Last Modification (+,-):" mflaag
     The utility prints inode data if the inode has been modified
     in the specified number of days.

   Days Since Last Change (+,-):" Cflag
     The utility prints inode data if the inode has been changed
     in the specified number of days.

   Altered After File:
     Enter a file name.  The utility prints inode data if the
     inode has been modified more recently than the specified
     file.

   List Only These Inodes:
     Enter a list of inodes.  The utility generates names for
     only those inodes specified in the list.

SEE ALSO
     finc(1M), find(1), frec(1M), ncheck(1M).

NOTES
     Only a single path name is generated for a multiple linked
     inode unless the -l option is specified.  When -l is
     specified, no selection criteria applies to the names
     generated; all possible names for every linked file on the
     file system are included in the output.

     On very large file systems, memory may run out before ff
     terminates.
