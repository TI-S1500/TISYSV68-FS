NETWORKS(1T)                                         NETWORKS(1T)

NAME
     networks - Displays Xerox Network Systems(TM) (XNS) network
     numbers and routers

SYNOPSIS
     networks -s

DESCRIPTION
   Purpose
     The networks command retrieves information on all the XNS
     networks in the internet.

     Each entry contains a network number, the 48 bit address of
     the network router, the hop count to reach that network, the
     communications carrier board (CCB) option port through which
     the network is reached, and the time in seconds since the
     router's last update.  This information is useful for
     monitoring normal operation and for troubleshooting the
     network.

   Options
      -s slot
          Specifies a chassis slot to be examined.  With this
          option, networks attempts only to open the given slot.
          The CCB in this slot must be configured and downloaded
          with the XNS Internet option, entered in response to
          the Define Transport Protocol prompt of the devadm
          utility.

   Discussion
     The networks command allows the user to display the network
     numbers of the networks in the XNS internet and the router
     addresses.  A maximum of 256 network entries can be returned
     using the networks command.  If no slot is specified (that
     is, the -s option is not specified), networks examines every
     slot for a CCB defined with the XNS internet protocol
     option.  If the option is found, networks reports the
     network information and continues searching the rest of the
     slots.

     If the examined CCB also functions as an XNS internet
     router, networks reports this additional capability before
     printing the routing entries.

     The following list explains the fields in the display
     returned by networks:

     Network Number
          The XNS network number of each network in the internet.

     Router Address
          The 48-bit address of the internet router through which
          the network may be reached.

     Hop Count
          The number of hops (routers) through which packets must
          pass to reach this network.  A hop count of 00 means
          the network is directly attached to the system.  A hop
          count of 16 means the network is unreachable at this
          time.

     Time Since Last Update
          The time since the router last sent a routing table
          update, where xx:yy is minutes:seconds.

EXAMPLES
     The following command line requests information on all the
     XNS networks on chassis slot 3:

          networks -s 3

     The following is an example of router information returned
     by networks upon normal completion:

                       NETWORKS - NETWORK CONNECTION STATISTICS

              Number of networks linked to ccb on slot 03 = 3

                                              TIME SINCE LAST UPDATE
          NETWORK #  ADDRESS         HOP COUNT  PORT       min:sec

DIAGNOSTICS
     The following messages can be displayed by the networks
     utility:

       usage: netu [-s <slot>]
       This system also functions as a network router.
       Error in opening device on slot x for networks.  Error
         = errno
       Error in retrieving NETWORKS parameters on slot x.
       Error = errno
       Error in closing device on slot x for NETWORKS.  Error
         = <status
       Error in -s slot; Invalid ccb slot.
       Unable to open a ccb configured with the XNS Internet
         Transport Protocol option on any slot.
       Unable to open a ccb configured with the XNS Internet
         Transport Protocol option on slot xx.
