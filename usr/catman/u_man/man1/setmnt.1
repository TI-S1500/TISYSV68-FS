SETMNT(1M)                                             SETMNT(1M)

NAME
     setmnt - Establishes the mount table

SYNOPSIS
     setmnt

DESCRIPTION
   Purpose
     The setmnt command creates the /etc/mnttab table (see
     mnttab(4)), which is needed for both the mount(1M) and
     umount(1M) commands.

   Discussion
     The setmnt command reads standard input and creates an
     mnttab entry for each line.  Input lines have the following
     format:

          filesys node

     where filesys is the name of the file system's special file
     and node is the root name of that file system.  Thus,
     filesys and node become the first two strings in the
     mnttab(4) entry.

FILES
     /etc/mnttab

SEE ALSO
     mnttab(4).

NOTES
     filesys or node cannot be longer than 32 characters.  The
     setmnt command silently enforces an upper limit on the
     maximum number of mnttab entries.
