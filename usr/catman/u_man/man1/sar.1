NAME
     sar - Invokes the system activity reporter

SYNOPSIS
     sar [-ubdycwaqvmrA] [ -o  file] t [ n ]

     sar [-ubdycwaqvmrA] [ -s  time] [ -e  time] [ -i  sec] [ -f
     file]

DESCRIPTION
     The first usage of sar shown in the SYNOPSIS samples
     cumulative activity counters in the operating system at n
     intervals of t seconds.  If the -o option is specified, sar
     saves the samples in file in binary format.  The default
     value of n is 1.

     With no sampling interval specified, as shown in the second
     line of the SYNOPSIS, sar extracts data from a previously
     recorded file, either the file specified by the -f option
     or, by default, the standard system activity daily data file
     /usr/adm/sa/sadd for the current day, dd.	The starting and
     ending times of the report can be bounded with the -s and -e
     time arguments of the form hh[:mm[:ss]].  The -i option
     selects records at sec second intervals.  Otherwise, all
     intervals found in the data file are reported.

     This activity reporter is called by sa2(1M).

   Options
     Subsets of data to be printed are specified by the following
     options.  The following list shows the option, a brief
     description of the option, the field names of the command
     output, and a description of those fields.

     -u   Report CPU utilization (the default):

	  %usr, %sys, %wio, %idle - portion of time running in
	  user mode, running in system mode, idle with some
	  process waiting for block I/O, and otherwise idle.

     -b   Report buffer activity:

	  bread/s, bwrit/s - transfers per second of data between
	  system buffers and disk or other block devices;

	  lread/s, lwrit/s - accesses of system buffers;

	  %rcache, %wcache - cache hit ratios, e. g., 1 -
	  bread/lread;

	  pread/s, pwrit/s - transfers via raw (physical) device
	  mechanism.

     -d   Report activity for each block device, e. g., disk or
	  tape drive.  When data is displayed, the device
	  specification dsk- is generally used to represent a
	  disk drive.  The device specification used to represent
	  a tape drive is machine-dependent.  The activity data
	  reported is:

	  %busy, avque - portion of time device was busy
	  servicing a transfer request, average number of
	  requests outstanding during that time;

	  r+w/s, blks/s - number of data transfers from or to
	  device, number of blocks transferred in 1K-byte units;

	  avwait, avserv - average time in ms. that transfer
	  requests wait idly on queue, and average time to be
	  serviced (which for disks includes seek, rotational
	  latency, and data transfer times).

     -y   Report tty device activity:

	  rawch/s, canch/s, outch/s - input character rate, input
	  character rate processed by canon, output character
	  rate;

	  rcvin/s, xmtin/s, mdmin/s - receive, transmit, and
	  modem interrupt rates.

     -c   Report system calls:

	  scall/s - system calls of all types;

	  sread/s, swrit/s, fork/s, exec/s - specific system
	  calls;

	  rchar/s, wchar/s - characters transferred by read and
	  write system calls.

     -w   Report system swapping, paging, and switching activity:

	  swpin/s, swpot/s, bswin/s, bswot/s - number of
	  transfers and number of bytes transferred for
	  swapins and swapouts;

	  pswch/s - process switches;

	  pgin/s, pgot/s, bpgin/s, bpgot/s - number of transfers
	  and number of bytes transferred for pageins and
	  pageouts.

     -a   Report use of file access system routines:
	  iget/s, namei/s, dirblk/s.

     -q   Report average queue length while occupied, and % of
	  time occupied:

	  runq-sz, %runocc - run queue of processes in memory and
	  runnable;

	  swpq-sz, %swpocc - swap queue of processes swapped out
	  but ready to run.

     -v   Report status of text, process, inode, and file tables:

	  text-sz, proc-sz, inod-sz, file-sz - entries/size for
	  each table, evaluated once at sampling point;

	  text-ov, proc-ov, inod-ov, file-ov - overflows
	  occurring between sampling points.

     -m   Report message and semaphore activities:

	  msg/s, sema/s - primitives per second.

     -r   Reports RAM disk activity:

	  r+w/s, blk/s - number of data transfers from or to RAM
	  disk per second, number of 1K-byte blocks transferred
	  from/to RAM disk.

     -A   Report all data.  Equivalent to -udqbwcayvmr.

EXAMPLES
     To see today's CPU activity so far, type the following:

	  sar

     The next example allows you to watch CPU activity evolve for
     10 minutes and save data:

	  sar -o temp 60 10

     The next example allows you to review disk and tape activity
     from the period specified by the previous example:

	  sar -d -f temp

FILES
     /usr/adm/sa/sadd daily data file, where dd are digits
     representing the day of the month.
