NAME
     join - Database operator that joins two relations

SYNOPSIS
     join -aejot file1 file2

DESCRIPTION
   Purpose
     The join command forms, on the standard output, a join of
     the two relations specified by the lines of file1 and file2.

   Options
     Some options use the argument n.  This argument should be a
     1 or a 2 referring to either file1 or file2, respectively.

     -an      In addition to the normal output, produces a line
	      for each unpairable line in file n.

     -e s     Replaces empty output fields by string s.

     -jn m    Joins on the mth field of file n.  If n is missing,
	      use the mth field in each file.  Fields are
	      numbered starting with 1.

     -o list  Outputs lines comprising the fields specified in
	      list, each element of which has the form n.m, where
	      n is a file number and m is a field number.  The
	      common field is not printed unless specifically
	      requested.

     -tc      Uses character c as a separator (tab character).
	      Every appearance of c in a line is significant.
	      The character c is used as the field separator for
	      both input and output.

   Discussion
     If file1 is -, the standard input is used.

     File1 and file2 must be sorted in increasing ASCII collating
     sequence on the fields on which they are to be joined, the
     default being the first field in each line.

     There is one line in the output for each pair of lines in
     file1 and file2 that have identical join fields.  The output
     line normally consists of the common field, then the rest of
     the line from file1, then the rest of the line from file2.

     The default input field separators are blank, tab, or
     newline.  In this case, multiple separators count as one
     field separator and leading separators are ignored.  The
     default output field separator is a blank.

EXAMPLE
     The following command line joins the password file and the
     group file, matching on the numeric group ID, and outputting
     the login name, the group name, and the login directory.  It
     is assumed that the files have been sorted in ASCII
     collating sequence on the group ID fields.

PROMPTS
   File 1:
     Enter the name of a file to be processed.

   File 2:
     Enter the name of the other file to be processed.

   Output File Name:
     Response to this prompt is optional.  Enter a file name to
     receive the output of the command.

   Unpairable Line File Number (0-2):
     Enter the number of the file whose unpairable lines are to
     be written to the output file specified.  Enter 0 for no
     information of either file to be written.	Enter 1 for file
     1.  Enter 2 for file 2.

   Field Line Output List:
     Response to this prompt is optional.  Enter the list of
     fields to be used for output.

   Field Replacement String:
     Response to this prompt is optional.  Enter the string to be
     used to replace empty output fields.

   Separator Character:
     Response to this prompt is optional.  Enter the character to
     be used in the separation of fields.

   Number of Fields to Join:
     Response to this prompt is optional.  Enter the number of
     fields to be joined.  The following prompt will appear for
     each entry:

   File Number (1,2):
     Response to this prompt is optional.  Enter the file number
     used in the selection of a field.

   Field Number:
     Enter the field number to be used.

SEE ALSO
     awk(1), comm(1), sort(1), uniq(1).

NOTES
     With default field separation, the collating sequence is
     that of sort -b; with -t, the sequence is that of a plain
     sort.

     Numeric file names may cause conflict when the -o option is
     used right before listing file names.
