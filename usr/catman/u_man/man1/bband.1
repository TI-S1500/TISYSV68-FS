BBAND(1T)                                               BBAND(1T)

NAME
     bband - Creates a bootable system

SYNOPSIS
     bband -dpt kernel

DESCRIPTION
   Purpose
     The bband command creates a bootable system in a load
     partition on disk or creates a bootable tape.

   Options
     -d device
          Specifies the device path name of the load partition or
          tape device from which the system is to be booted.  If
          device is not specified /dev/dsk/sys:unx1 is used.

     -p primitive
          Specifies the name of the executable object file that
          contains the System Test Boot Master (STBM) primitive.
          This primitive performs automatic configuration, boots
          secondary processors, and performs certain
          initializations for TI System V.  If this option is not
          specified, the name /primitive is used.

     -t config
          Indicates that a bootable tape is to be created.  This
          option is required for tape and must not be specified
          if the boot partition is on disk.  Bootable tapes must
          be high density.  The disk device path name of the
          configuration partition included on the tape is config.

   Discussion
     Before a system can be booted, it must be installed in a
     load partition.  A load partition is a special kind of disk
     partition that can exist on disk, tape, or other STBM load
     source.  The bband command installs the operating system and
     a loader called the STBM primitive in a load partition on
     disk.  The load partition must already exist and must be
     specified by a device path name.  The load partition must be
     large enough to hold the operating system and the primitive.

     The command can also create a bootable tape from the
     operating system and the STBM primitive.  The utility builds
     a volume label, partition table, and load partition.  Then
     bband copies a configuration partition on the tape.  Raw
     devices cannot be used to create bootable tapes.
