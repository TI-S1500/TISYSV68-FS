STRIP(1)						 STRIP(1)

NAME
     strip - Strips symbol and line number information from a
     common object file

SYNOPSIS
     strip -blrVx files

DESCRIPTION
   Purpose
     The strip command strips the symbol table and line number
     information from common object files, including archives.
     The purpose of this command is to reduce the file storage
     overhead taken by the object file.

   Options
     -b   Does not strip static or external symbol in formation
	  or strip scoping information (e.g., beginning and end
	  of block delimiters).

     -l   Strips line number information only; does not strip any
	  symbol table information.  Line number information will
	  not be in the file unless it was compiled with the -g
	  option.

     -r   Resets the relocation indexes into the symbol table

     -V   Gives the version of strip command

     -x   Does not strip static or external symbol information

   Discussion
     If there are any relocation entries in the object file and
     any symbol table information is to be stripped, strip will
     complain and terminate without stripping file unless the -r
     flag is used.

     If the strip command is executed on a common archive file
     (see ar(4)) the archive symbol table will be removed.  The
     archive symbol table must be restored by executing the ar(1)
     command with the s option before the archive can be link
     edited by the ld(1) command.  strip will instruct the user
     with appropriate warning messages when this situation
     arises.  strip is used to reduce the file storage overhead.

PROMPTS
   Input File Name(s):
     Enter the name of the files to be expanded.

   No Line Number Information:
     Initial value is no.  If you enter yes, the line number
     information is stripped from the input file.

   Not Strip Scoping Information:
     Initial value is no.  If you enter yes, the scoping
     information is stripped.

   Reset the Relocation Indexes:
     Initial value is no.  If you enter yes, the relocation
     indexes are reset into the symbol table.

   Report Version Number:
     Initial value is no.  If you enter yes, the version number
     of the process is printed.

   Retain Static/External Info:
     Initial value is no.  If you enter yes, the static or
     external symbol information is not stripped.

EXAMPLE
     The following example strips the line numbers and symbol
     table information from a file called accept.o:

	  strip accept.o

DIAGNOSTICS
     strip:  name:  cannot open
		      name cannot be read.

		      name is not an appropriate common object
		      file.

     strip:  name:  relocation entries present; cannot strip
		      name contains relocation entries and the -r
		      flag is not used, the symbol table
