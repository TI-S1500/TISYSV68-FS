NL(1)                                                       NL(1)

NAME
     nl - Invokes a line numbering filter

SYNOPSIS
     nl -bdfhilnpsvw file

DESCRIPTION
   Purpose
     The nl command reads lines from the named file or the
     standard input if no file is named and reproduces the lines
     on the standard output.  Lines are numbered on the left in
     accordance with the command options in effect.

   Options
     The type option value specifies the type of lines to be
     numbered.  The following types are available:

          a  All lines (see the -l option for numbering empty
             lines)

          n  No lines numbered

          p  Lines that contain the regular expression ``string''
             immediately following p

          t  All non-empty lines (an empty line is one that
             begins with the newline character)

     Command options can appear in any order and can be
     intermingled with an optional file name.  Only one file can
     be named.

     -btype    Specifies which lines in the logical body of a
               page are numbered.  The default type is t.

     -dxx      Changes the delimiter characters specifying the
               start of a logical page section from the default
               characters (\:) to two user-specified characters.
               If only one character is entered, the second
               character remains the default character (:).  No
               space should appear between the -d and the
               delimiter characters.  To enter a backslash, use
               two backslashes.

     -ftype    Specifies which lines in the logical footer are
               numbered.  The default type is n.

     -htype    Specifies which lines in the logical header are
               numbered.  The default type is n.

     -iincr    Numbers logical page lines with the increment
               value incr.  Default is 1.

     -lnum     Defines num as the number of blank lines to be
               considered as one.  For example, -l2 results in
               only the second adjacent blank being numbered (if
               the appropriate -ha, -ba, and/or -fa option is
               set).  Default is 1.  This option is effective
               only if the a type is in effect.

     -nformat  Numbers lines according to format.  Default format
               is rn (right justified).  Recognized values are:

               ln   Left justified, leading zeroes suppressed

               rn   Right justified, leading zeroes suppressed

               rz   Right justified, leading zeroes kept

     -p        Supresses restarting numbering at logical page
               delimiters.

     -ssep     Separates the line number and the corresponding
               text line with the character or characters sep.
               Default sep is a tab.

     -vstart#  Numbers logical page lines with the initial value
               start#.  Default is 1.

     -wwidth   Uses width number of characters for the line
               number.  Default width is 6.

   Discussion
     The nl command views the text it reads in terms of logical
     pages.  Line numbering is reset at the start of each logical
     page.  A logical page consists of a header, a body, and a
     footer section.  Empty sections are valid.  Different line
     numbering options are independently available for header,
     body, and footer (e.g., no numbering of header and footer
     lines while numbering blank lines only in the body).

     The start of logical page sections is signaled by input
     lines containing nothing but the following delimiter
     character(s):

     Line contents  Start of

     \:\:\:         header

     \:\:           body

     \:             footer

     Unless otherwise specified with an option, nl assumes the
     text being read is in a single logical page body.

EXAMPLE
     The following command numbers files 1 and 2 starting at line
     number 10 with an increment of ten.  The logical page
     delimiters are !+.

          nl -v10 -i10 -d!+ file1 file2
