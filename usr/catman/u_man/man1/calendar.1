CALENDAR(1)                                           CALENDAR(1)

NAME
     calendar - Invokes a reminder service

SYNOPSIS
     calendar [-]

DESCRIPTION
   Purpose
     The calendar command consults the file named calendar in the
     current directory and prints out lines that contain today's
     or tomorrow's date.  Most month-day dates such as Aug. 24,
     august 24, 8/24 are recognized.  calendar checks the DATE
     environment variable to determine whether to check for
     month-day or day-month dates. The DATE environment variable
     has the form "DD-MM-YY hh:mm:ss" where DD means day; MM
     means month; YY means year;  hh means hours; mm, minutes;
     and ss, seconds. This DATE setting would match dates such as
     24 Aug., 24 august, and 24-8. If DATE is not set, it
     defaults to "MM/DD/YY hh:mm:ss".  When the command is
     executed on weekends, lines that contain any date through
     Monday are printed.

     When the - option is specified, calendar executes for every
     user with a calendar file in the login directory and sends
     them the calendar file by mail(1).  Normally this is done
     daily by facilities such as cron(1M) in the TI System V
     operating system.
