MORE(1)                                                   MORE(1)

NAME
     more - Invokes the file perusal filter for VDT viewing

SYNOPSIS
     more -dfln +linenumber +/pattern names

DESCRIPTION
   Purpose
     The more command is a filter that allows examination of a
     continuous text one screen at a time on a VDT.  It normally
     pauses after each screen, printing - -more- - at the bottom
     of the screen.  If the user then presses RETURN, one more
     line is displayed.  If the user presses the space bar,
     another screen is displayed.

   Options
     -n   Specifies the size (n lines) of the window that more
          uses.

     -d   Prompts the user with the following message at the end
          of each screen:
          - -more- - [Press space bar to continue, q to abort]

          This is useful if more is being used in some setting,
          such as a class, where many users may be unfamiliar
          with more.

     -f   This causes more to count logical, rather than screen
          lines.  That is, long lines are not folded.

     -l   Do not treat CTRL-L (form feed) specially.  If this
          option is not given, more pauses after any line that
          contains a CTRL-L, as if the end of a screen had been
          reached.  Also, if a file begins with a form feed, the
          screen is cleared before the file is printed.

     +linenumber
          Begins at linenumber.  This option and +/pattern are
          mutually exclusive.

     +/pattern
          Begins two lines before the line containing the regular
          expression pattern.  This option and +linenumber are
          mutually exclusive.  The pattern must be less than 80
          characters.

     The environment variable TERM is referenced to determine the
     terminal type.  The more command looks in the file named
     /etc/termcap to determine terminal characteristics and to
     determine the default window size.  On a terminal capable of
     displaying 24 lines, the default window size is 22 lines.

     If more is reading from a file, rather than a pipe, then a
     percentage is displayed along with the prompt - -More- -.
     This gives the fraction of the file (in characters, not
     lines) that has been read so far.

     Commands that can be typed when more pauses, and their
     effects, are as follows (i is an optional integer argument,
     defaulting to 1).  Unless otherwise noted, the commands take
     effect immediately. It is not necessary to press RETURN.

     i<RETURN> Displays i more lines. The window size becomes i
               lines.

     <SPACE BAR>
               Displays another screen.

     i<CTRL-D> Displays 11 more lines (a scroll).  If i is given,
               then the scroll size is set to i.

     d         Same as <CTRL-D>.

     iz        Same as pressing SPACE BAR except that i, if
               present, becomes the new window size.

     is        Skips i lines and prints a screen of lines.

     if        Skips i screens and prints a screen of lines.

     q or Q    Exits from more.

     =         Displays the current line number.

     v         Starts up the vi(1) editor at the current line.

     h         Gives a description of all the more commands
               (help).

     i/expr    Searches for the i-th occurrence of the regular
               expression expr.  If there are less than i
               occurrences of expr and the input is a file
               (rather than a pipe), then the position in the
               file remains unchanged.  Otherwise, a screen is
               displayed starting two lines before the place
               where the expression was found.  The user's erase
               and kill characters may be used to edit the
               regular expression.  Erasing back past the first
               column cancels the search command.

     in        Searches for the ith occurrence of the last
               regular expression entered.

     '         Goes to the point from which the last search
               started.  If no search has been performed in the
               current file, the apostrophe command goes back to
               the beginning of the file.

     !command  Invokes a shell (as specified by the environment
               variable SHELL) with command. The characters % and
               ! in command are replaced with the current file
               name and the previous shell command respectively.
               If there is no current file name, % is not
               expanded.  The sequences \% and \! are replaced by
               % and ! respectively.

     i:n       Skips to the ith next file given in the command
               line (skips to last file if next does not make
               sense).

     i:p       Skips to the ith previous file given in the
               command line.  If this command is given in the
               middle of printing out a file, more goes back to
               the beginning of the file. If i does not make
               sense, more skips back to the first file.  If more
               is not reading from a file, the bell is rung and
               nothing else happens.

     :f        Displays the current file name and line number.

     :q or :Q  Exits from more (same as q or Q).

     .         Repeats the previous command.

     Up to the time when the command character itself is given,
     the user can press the line kill character to cancel the
     numerical argument being formed.  In addition, the user can
     press the erase character to redisplay the - -more- -(xx%)
     message.

     The terminal is set to noecho mode by this program so that
     the output can be continuous.  What you type will thus not
     show on your terminal except for the / and ! commands.

     If the standard output is not a terminal, then more acts
     just like cat(1), except that a header is printed before
     each file (if there is more than one).
