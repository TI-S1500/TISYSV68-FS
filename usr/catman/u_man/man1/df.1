DF(1M)                                                     DF(1M)

NAME
     df - Report the number of free disk blocks and inodes

SYNOPSIS
     df [-lt] [-f] [file-system | directory]

DESCRIPTION
     The df command prints out the number of free 1K-byte blocks
     and free inodes in mounted file systems or directories by
     examining the counts kept in the super-blocks.

     file-system can be specified either by device name (e.g.,
     /dev/dsk/sys:usr) or by mount point directory name (e.g.,
     /usr).

     directory can be a directory name.  The report presents
     information for the device that contains the directory.

     If no arguments are used, the free space on all locally and
     remotely mounted file systems is printed.

     The df command uses the following options:

     -l   Reports only on local file systems.

     -t   Causes the figures for total allocated blocks and
          inodes to be reported as well as the free blocks and
          inodes.

     -f   Makes an actual count of the blocks in the free list
          rather than taking the figure from the super-block
          (free inodes are not reported).

NOTE
     If multiple remote resources are listed that reside on the
     same file system on a remote machine, each listing after the
     first one will be marked with an asterisk.

FILES
     /dev/dsk/*
     /etc/mnttab
