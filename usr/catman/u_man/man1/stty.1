NAME
     stty - Sets the modes for a terminal

SYNOPSIS
     stty -ag modes

DESCRIPTION
   Purpose
     The stty command sets certain terminal I/O modes for the
     current standard input device.

   Options
     -a   Reports all mode settings.

     -g   Reports current settings in a form that can be used as
	  an argument to another stty command.

   Discussion
     Without options, stty reports the setting of certain modes.
     Detailed information about the modes listed in the first
     five groups that follow can be found in termio(7).  Although
     many combinations of modes make no sense, no sanity checking
     is performed.

   Control Modes
     parenb (-parenb)
	       Enables (disables) parity generation and
	       detection.

     parodd (-parodd)
	       Selects odd (even) parity.

     cs5 cs6 cs7 cs8
	       Selects character size (see termio(7)).

     0	       Hangs up phone line immediately.

     50 75 110 134 150 200 300 600 1200 1800 2400 4800 9600 19200 exta
       extb
	       Sets terminal baud rate to the number given, if
	       possible.  (All speeds are not supported by all
	       hardware interfaces.)

     ixon (-ixon)

   Local Modes
     isig (-isig)
	       Enables (disables) the checking of characters
	       against the special control characters INTR and
	       QUIT.

     icanon (-icanon)
	       Enables (disables) canonical input (ERASE and KILL

	       typed.

     echoe (-echoe)
	       Echoes (does not echo) ERASE character as a
	       backspace-space-backspace string.  Note: this mode
	       erases the ERASEed character on many CRT
	       terminals; however, it does not keep track of
	       column position and, as a result, may be confusing
	       on escaped characters, tabs, and backspaces.

     echok (-echok)
	       Echoes (does not echo) NL after KILL character.

     lfkc (-lfkc)
	       Performs the same task as echok (-echok);
	       obsolete.

     echonl (-echonl)
	       Echoes (does not echo) NL.

     noflsh (-noflsh)
	       Disables (enables) flush after INTR or QUIT.

     stwrap (-stwrap)
	       Disables (enables) truncation of lines longer than
	       79 characters on a synchronous line.  (Not
	       supported.)

     stflush (-stflush)
	       Enables (disables) flush on a synchronous line
	       after every write(2).  (Not supported.)

     stappl (-stappl)
	       Uses application mode (use line mode) on a
	       synchronous line.  (Not supported.)

   Control Assignments
     control-character c
	       Set control-character to c, where control-
	       character is erase, kill, intr, quit, eof, eol,
	       ctab, min, or time(Use ctab with -stappl and use
	       min and time with -icanon; termio(7) provides
	       further information.) If c is preceded by a \^ (a
	       caret escaped from the shell), the value used is
	       the corresponding CTRL character (^d is a CTRL-d).
	       A ^? is interpreted as DEL and ^- is interpreted
	       as undefined.

     line i    Sets line discipline to i (0 < i < 127 ).  (Not
	       supported.)

   Combination Modes
     evenp or parity
	       Enables parenb and cs7.

     oddp      Enables parenb, cs7, and parodd.

     -parity, -evenp, or -oddp
	       Disables parenb, and set cs8.

     raw (-raw or cooked)
	       Enables (disables) raw input and output (no ERASE,
	       KILL, INTR, QUIT, EOT, or output post processing).

     nl (-nl)  Unsets (sets) icrnl, onlcr.  In addition -nl
	       unsets inlcr, igncr, ocrnl, and onlret.

     lcase (-lcase)
	       set (unset) xcase, iuclc, and olcuc.

     LCASE (-LCASE)
	       Performs same function as lcase (-lcase).

     tabs (-tabs or tab3)
	       Preserves (expands to spaces) tabs when printing.

     ek        Resets ERASE and KILL characters back to normal #
	       and @.

     sane      Resets all modes to some reasonable values.

     term      Sets all modes suitable for the terminal type
	       term, where term is one of the following:  tty33,
	       tty37, vt05, tn300, ti700, or tek.  (Not
	       supported.)

PROMPTS
   Display or Set (d,s):
     The default response is d.  Enter s to set terminal
     settings.	Enter d to display terminal settings.

   Report All Mode Settings:
     Initial value is no.  If you enter yes, all mode settings
     are reported.

   Settings:
     Enter the select terminal commands to modify your terminal.

EXAMPLES
     The following command shows some of the stty values
     currently in effect:

	  stty

     The following sets the terminal erase character to CTRL-h
     and sets the line kill character to CTRL-u:

	  stty erase '^h' kill '^u'

     The first of the following commands resets all modes to
     reasonable values.  The second command displays the values.

	  stty sane
	  stty -a

     The stty -a command displays values similar to the
     following:
     speed = 19200 baud; line = 0; intr = ^C; quit = ^; erase = ^H; kill = ^U;
     eof = ^D; eol = ^@
     parenb parodd cs7 -cstopb -hupcl cread clocal
     -ignbrk brkint -ignpar -parmrk -inpck -istrip -inclr -igncr icrnl -iuclc
     ixon -ixany ixoff
     isig icanon -xcase echo echoe echok -echonl -noflsh
     opost -olcuc onlcr -oncrnl -onocr -onlret -ofill -ofdel tab3

NOTE
     The command stty sane does not alter the present parity or
     number of bits.
