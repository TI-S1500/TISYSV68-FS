TSORT(1)                                                 TSORT(1)

NAME
     tsort - Performs a topological sort

SYNOPSIS
     tsort [file]

DESCRIPTION
   Purpose
     The tsort command produces on the standard output a totally
     ordered list of items consistent with a partial ordering of
     items mentioned in the input file.

   Discussion
     The input consists of pairs of items (nonempty strings)
     separated by blanks.  Pairs of different items indicate
     ordering.  Pairs of identical items indicate presence, but
     not ordering.  If no file is specified, the standard input
     is understood.

PROMPTS
   Input File Name:
     Enter the name of the file to be sorted.

   Output File Name:
     Response to this prompt is optional.  Enter a file name to
     receive the output of the command.

SEE ALSO
     lorder(1).

DIAGNOSTICS
     Odd data
            There is an odd number of fields in the input file.

NOTES
     This command uses a quadratic algorithm.  Modifying this
     program for the typical use of ordering a library archive
     file is probably not worth the effort.
