SHOWMSG(1T)                                           SHOWMSG(1T)

NAME
     showmsg - Prints the expanded message for a given error

SYNOPSIS
     showmsg -f tag_no

DESCRIPTION
   Purpose
     The showmsg program displays both the problem description
     text and the solution description text (if any) for an error
     message. The ??? string in the problem description text
     indicates the placement of text supplied by the system when
     the error occurs.

   Option
     -f msg_set
          Allows the program to access message texts other than
          the TI-supplied message sets.  Message numbers
          1,000,000 and above are for messages generated by TI-
          supplied programs.  The utility recognizes these
          numbers and automatically retrieves the texts for these
          messages; the -f option is unnecessary.  A white space
          (blank or tab) is required between the option and its
          value.

   Arguments
     tag_no
          Specifies a number that identifies the message.
          Numbers greater than or equal to 1,000,000 identify
          TI-supplied error message text.  Tag numbers less than
          1,000,000 indicate error message text written by users
          and require the -f option.

EXAMPLE
     In response to this command, showmsg 1001040, the following
     information is displayed:

          THE PROBLEM DESCRIPTION FOR MESSAGE 1001040 IS:

          File ??? changed size

          THE SOLUTION DESCRIPTION IS:

          Based on the size of the file saved in the inode, tar
          calculated how many 512-byte blocks were needed to hold
          the body of the file, expecting to read this many
          blocks from the file, and write this many blocks to the
          tape.  Either end of the file was found before this
          many blocks were read, or the required number of blocks
          were written without finding the end of the file.
          Somehow, while tar was working on the file, it changed
          size.  (When tar actually displays this message due to
          encountering an actual error, the string "???" is
          replaced with the name of the file that changed size.
          See NOTES below.)

     The following command displays the problem description and
     solution description for message 3549, retrieving the texts
     from the file /usr/customer/msgs/ptext/USA and
     /usr/customer/msgs/stext/USA:

          showmsg -f /usr/customer/msgs 3549

PROMPTS
   Message Number:
     Enter the number that identifies the message.

   Message File:
     Enter the message file if not in the TI-supplied message
     set.

SEE ALSO
     mkmsg(1T), pick_msg_set(3T), printm(3T).

NOTES
     When showmsg displays a message note that there will be a
     string "???"  contained within the message, this string is
     used to represent file names, numbers, etc. When the
     messages are displayed due to actual errors encountered this
     string will be replaced with actual file names, numbers,
     etc. showmsg uses these strings to illustrate the format of
     the message, rather than its exact contents when an error is
     encountered.
