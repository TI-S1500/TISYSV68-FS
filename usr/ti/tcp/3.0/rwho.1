RWHO(1)                                                   RWHO(1)

NAME
     rwho - who is logged in on local network or network users 
            logged in to the local machine

SYNOPSIS
     rwho [ -atl ]

DESCRIPTION
     Rwho lists users logged in on machines on the local network.
     The format is similar to that of who(1).  Without options,
     only network users who have typed in the last hour are listed.  
     For each user listed, rwho displays the user name; the host 
     name; and the date and time the user logged in.  If the user has 
     not typed in the last minute, rwho also displays the user's idle 
     time in hours and minutes.

     Rwho understands the following option:

          -a   List all users on active nodes (users idle for
               more than an hour are listed).

	  -l   List network users who are logged in to the local
               machine and display the hostname of the machine they
	       are logged in from (If the name is not known then the
	       internet address will be displayed).

          -t   List a trace of network (rlogin/telnet) connections
               to the local machine and what machine they came from.
               The time listed in the entry is the time the connection
               was initiated.  The entries are not added to the accounting
               file (/etc/rwtmp) until the connection is closed.  An
               entry containing "logon attempt" denotes that an unsuccesful
	       network login attempt was made. 

     If information from a host is more than five minutes old,
     the host is assumed to be down and its users are not listed.

REQUIREMENTS
     Each host to be listed must be running the rwhod(1M) server,
     which broadcasts a status packet once every 1 - 3 minutes.
     The local host must also be running this server to maintain
     the /usr/spool/rwho/whod.* files.  Since broadcasts do not 
     cross gateways, hosts on other networks will not be listed.

FILES
     /usr/spool/rwho/whod.*   information about other nodes
     /etc/rutmp	              information about current network sessions
     /etc/rwtmp	              information about past network sessions

SEE ALSO
     ruptime(1), rwhod(1M).

WARNINGS
     The /etc/rwtmp file is similar to the /etc/wtmp file in that it will
     continue to grow and could potentially fill up your root file system.
