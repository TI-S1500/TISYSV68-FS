Patch:		os32029
Product:	TIsysV 3.2.2
Created:	September 27, 1990
STR's:		NONE YET 
OS:		3.2.2
Summary:	Streams-based pseudo tty driver 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Effected Hardware and Software Configurations
---------------------------------------------
	Any 1500 running 3.2.2.

Purpose of Patch:
-----------------

	This patch contains a port of the Streams-based pseudo tty driver
 	required to run JSB multiview or X terminals.
	
Instructions for Installing Patch:
----------------------------------

	This patch will create the 257 pseudo-tty device
	nodes, /dev/ptmx and /dev/pts000 through /dev/pts256.  This creates
        sufficient resources for 256 pseudo-tty sessions, which could be
    	256 terminals running JSB multiview with one window, 42 terminals
	running JSB multiview with 6 windows, or some combination thereof.
	This patch must be installed on 3.2.2 only.  In 3.2.2, the code
	for the pseudo-tty device driver is in the kernel, but the
        device nodes have not been created.  This patch will create them.

	To install this patch, as super user, execute the
	install script.  

	You must use the cband utility to configure the system to run the
	streams-based pseudo tty driver.  In particular, you must specify
        the number of streams queues, number of streams, and max pushed
     	streams modules for the pseudo tty driver to operate.  Other 
	parameters may be adjusted as necessary to tune the system.  The max
	pushed streams modules is two.  The following are suggested guidelines
	and may need to be incremented or adjusted according to system
	performance or the presence of other packages on the system which
	use streams resources, for example tcp/ip.

	Number of streams queues:	2048
	Number of streams:		256 
	Number of linked streams:	0
	Number of streams events:	32
	Extra event cells:		6
	Max pushed streams modules:	2 
	Max streams data size:		4096
	Max streams control size:	4096
	Low priority threshold:		80
	Med priority threshold:		90
	4096 byte block count:		16
	2048 byte block count:		64
	1024 byte block count:		64
	512 byte block count:		64
	256 byte block count:		512
	128 byte block count:		512
	64 byte block count:		512
	16 byte block count:		128
	4 byte block count:		128


Instructions for Verifying that the Patch installed
----------------------------------------------------
	
	Execute the command
		"ls -al /dev/pt* | more"
	Verify that the device nodes "/dev/pmtx" and
		"/dev/pts00" through "/dev/pts256" exist.
	If those are found the patch installed correctly.

Instructions for removing patch from the system:
------------------------------------------------

	This patch can be removed by deleting 
	/dev/ptmx and /dev/pts000 through /dev/pts256.
