1000501~0~Can't open file %s\n~
An attempt to open a file failed.  Some of the more common reasons are:
     1.  A syntax error exists in the file path name.
     2.  The file does not exist and the create flag is not set.
     3.  Access permission is denied for the file or a path name component.
     4.  The specified path name is a directory, and you are trying to open
	 it for writing.
     5.  You are attempting to write to a read-only file.
     6.  You are exceeding the maximum number of open files allowed.
 This error generates a second error message containing the reason
 for the failure.  If the reason for the failure is not obvious, the
 second error code can be found in this same manual or with the
 showmsg command.~
1000502~0~Can't close file %s\n~
System error - Notify the system administrator.~
1000503~0~Can't stat file %s\n~
The program cannot determine the file inode information.  Some of the
more common reasons for this failure are:
   1. The file does not exist.
   2. The file name syntax is bad.
   3. Search permission is denied for a directory in the path name.~
1000504~0~Can't create file %s\n~
Check for the following conditions:
   1. The file name syntax is bad.
   2. Search permission is denied for a directory in the path name.
   3. Write permission is denied for the file or its patent.
   4. The file would reside in a read-only file system.
   5. The file name already exists, and is a directory.
   6. Too many files are already open.~
1000505~0~Can't find file %s\n~
The program is trying to access a file, but cannot find it.  Are you sure
there is not a typing error?  Make sure that every component in the path name
exists and is spelled properly.  Are all of the needed intermediate
directories specified?

Other reasons a file may not be found are:
	1.  A component in the path name is not a directory, or does not
	    exist.
	2.  Search permission is denied for one of the directories in
	    the path name.
	3.  The file really does not exist.~
1000506~0~Can't read file %s\n~
A read request can fail if read permission is denied or if the file is not
open.~
1000507~0~Can't write file %s\n~
An attempt to write to a file failed.  The most common reasons are:
     1.  The file is write protected.
     2.  The file is mounted on a read-only file system.
This error generates a second error message containing the reason for the
failure.  If the reason for the failure is not obvious, the second error
code can be found in this manual entry or with the showmsg command.~
1000508~0~Can't exec program %s\n~
Make sure the file is executable.  Check the syntax of the file name.
Refer to exec(2) in the TI System V Programmer's Reference manual for
other conditions that could cause the exec request to fail.~
1000509~0~Can't copy file %s\n~
Make sure the file is readable and that the destination of the copy is
legal.~
1000510~0~File name too long; %s\n~
File names are generally limited to 14 characters.  Some utilities have
limits on how long the full path name of the file can be.~
1000511~0~Can't chdir to directory %s\n~
This error indicates a failure of the chdir system call. This system call can
fail for a variety of reasons. It can fail because the pathname is not a
directory, because the user does not have access to the directory, or because
the directory does not exist. There are also other reasons for this failure.
Please make sure that the directory exists, has proper permissions, and is a
directory.~
1000512~0~Can't link %s to file %s\n~
An attempt to link a specified path name to an existing path name failed.  Some
of the more common reasons include:
     1.  A component of either path prefix is not a directory.
     2.  A component of either path prefix does not exist.
     3.  Access permission is denied for a component of either path prefix.
     4.  The link already exists.
     5.  The two specified path names are in different file systems.
     6.  The link requires writing in a directory that denies write permission.
     7.  The link requires writing in a directory on a read-only file system.
This error generates a second error message containing the reason for the
failure.  If the reason for the failure is not obvious, the second error code
can be found in this manual entry or with the showmsg command.~
1000513~0~Can't chmod on file %s\n~
Only the owner can change the permissions on a file.  Refer to the chmod(2)
entry in the TI System V Programmer's Reference manual for other causes of
this problem.~
1000514~0~Invalid argument %s\n~
Check the documentation for this command to make sure you are using the option
correctly.~
1000515~0~No more memory\n~
Try again.  If the command still does not work, notify the system administrator.~
1000516~0~Option %c is illegal\n~
Check the documentation for this command to make sure you are using the option
correctly.~
1000517~0~Option %s is illegal\n~
Check the documentation for this command to make sure you are using the option
correctly.~
1000518~0~The %c option requires an argument\n~
Check the documentation for this command to make sure you are using the option
correctly.~
1000520~0~Read error on file %s\n~~
1000521~0~Write error on file %s\n~
An attempt to write to a file resulted in an unrecoverable I/O error.
Possible causes include the following:
	1.  The file size has been exceeded.
	2.  The disk is full.
	3.  There is a hardware problem.
Notify your system administrator.~
1000522~0~Seek error on file %s\n~~
1000523~0~Can't chown for file %s\n~
Only the owner can change the permissions on a file.  Refer to the chmod(2)
entry in the TI System V Programmer's Reference manual for other causes
of this problem.~
1000524~0~Can't mknod for %s\n~
An attempt to create a directory or file failed.  Some of the more common
reasons include:
     1.  A syntax error in the directory/file path name.
     2.  The specified directory/file already exists.
     3.  Access permission is denied for some component of the specified
	 path name.
     4.  A component of the specified path name is not a directory.
     5.  A component of the specified path name does not exist.
     6.  Attempting to create a directory/file in a read-only file system.
The maximum length of the path name is 128 characters, and the maximum length
of any path name component is 14 characters.  This error generates a second
error message containing the reason for the failure.  If the reason for the
failure is not obvious, the second error code can be found in this
manual entry or with the showmsg command.~

After all the specified files have been copied, the count for this file shows
that all the other files linked to it have not been copied to the tape.
Probably, the other files linked to this one were not specified.  When the
tape is restored, tar will not know which other files were originally linked to
this one, and that linkage information will be lost.\n~
1001035~0~Checksum error on file header.\n~
This may not be a tar tape.  Tar will attempt to find the next file on the
tape and proceed from there.~
1001036~0~%s is not a file: not written\n~
The file that tar is trying to write to tape is neither a regular file nor
a directory.  Nothing has been written to the tape.~
1001037~0~Archive   %s is linked to %s\n~
THIS IS A NORMAL MESSAGE.  There is no error.
The file being written to tape is linked to another file that has
already been written to tape.  Only the file name and linking information will
actually be written to tape.  The body of the file is already on the tape
under the name of the first file.~
1001038~0~Out of memory - link information lost\n~
The tar utility has found a file that has other files linked to it.  No more
memory is available to permit tar to save the file name, inode, etc., of this
file so the other files can be linked to it.  This file will be written
to tape, but the other files can't be linked to it.  They will also be written
to the tape.  No file contents will be lost, but the link between the files
will be lost.~

THIS IS A NORMAL MESSAGE
This file has been written to the tape.~
1001040~0~File %s changed size\n~
Based on the size of the file saved in the inode, tar calculated how many
512-byte blocks were needed to hold the body of the file, expecting to read
this many blocks from the file and write this many blocks to the tape.
Either the end of the file was found before this many blocks were read or
the required number of blocks were written without finding the end of the
file.  Somehow, while tar was working on the file, it changed size.~
1001041~0~Extract   can't link %s\n~
This file was supposed to be linked to another file that had been restored
from the tape earlier.	For some reason, the link could not be made.~

#
1002340~0~
Usage:	cut  -clist  [file ...]
	cut  -flist  [-dchar] [-s] [file ...]\n~
The cut command was invoked with an invalid option.  Only -c,-f,-d, and -s
are valid.  Check for a typographical error, or see cut(1) in the
TI System V User's Reference for details on the correct syntax.~
1002341~0~No delimiter character was entered\n~
The -d option is used in conjunction with the -f option and indicates that
the fields to be cut are bounded by some delimiting character.	If the field
delimiter is the tab character, omit the -d option entirely because this is
the default delimiter.	Otherwise, you must use the -d option and specify
the delimiting character by typing it immediately behind the -d (no space).~
1002342~0~A bad list was given for the -c or -f option\n~
Probably a typographical error.  The form of a list element is either:	n,
or p-q,  where n signifies a field or column and p-q signifies a range of
fields or columns to be selected from the input file.  The value of n, p, and
q may be any integer between 1 and 1023.  Both p and q are optional components
of the list element.  The omission of p results in a range from 1-q, and the
omission of q results in a range from p-1023.  The - is a valid list element
and results in a range from 1 through 1023, effectively selecting every
column or field from the input file.  If p and q are used together in a list
element range, the value of q must be larger than the value of p.  Multiple list
elements must be separated by a comma, except that the last element should
not have a trailing comma.  No nonnumeric characters are allowed in the list
except for the comma and the hyphen as mentioned above.  See cut(1) in the
TI System V User's Reference for some examples of proper list syntax.~
1002343~0~Either the -c or the -f option is required\n~
Use -f when the data in the file consists of fixed or variable length fields
that are bounded by a delimiting character.  Use -c when the data in the file
is to be extracted from certain positions (columns) within the file.~
1002344~0~No fields were specified\n~~
1002345~0~An input line was too long\n~
The maximum number of characters allowed on a single line is 1023.  This error
occurs when cut is searching an input line for a delimiting character, and the
delimiter is not found before the character buffer limit is reached.~
1002346~0~Can't handle multiple adjacent backspaces\n~
If the input data contains more than one backspace character in a row, cut is
not able to process the input.~

1003687~0~Illegal hardware configuration: LAN option cards in Port 0 and
Port 1 cannot be on the same network~
The netecho utility has discovered an invalid hardware configuration.
When a CCB has two local area network (LAN) option cards installed, it is
imperative that they not be connected to the same physical network.
Since Ethernet(R) is a half duplex transmission media, having two LAN option
cards on the same CCB and attached to the same network does not improve
performance.  In fact, this configuration may cause unpredictable results
when it is operating.  This problem is severe and you should contact your
system administrator immediately.

installed and scheduled.
This is an informative message.~
1003822~0~Resource error occurred: FD left= %x, BD left= %x\n~
This is an informative message.
The 82586 LAN coprocessor device service routine (DSR) detected that
the 82586 has encountered a no-resource error, which means the 82586 receive
unit runs out of memory resources and is discarding incoming frames. The
memory resource is a group of receive buffers linked together by a list of
Frame Descriptors (FD) and Buffer Descriptors (BD). When the 82586 receive
unit detects the end of FD list or the end of BD list, an interrupt will be
generated and the receive unit is set to be in the no-resource state. The
82586 LAN coprocessor DSR will try to recover from this situation by supplying
new buffers, FDs and BDs to the 82586 and re-starting the receive unit.
The netstat utility can be used to find out the information about the maximum
number of FDs and BDs supplied and minimum number of FDs and BDs reached.~

chip lock-up situation on the indicated port.  The recovery effort of the 82586
DSR failed.  Redownload the communications carrier board or the network terminal
concentrator.  This may indicate a hardware problem on the option card.~
1003826~0~Recovered from 82586 chip lock-up on port %x\n~
The 82586 LAN coprocessor device service routine (DSR) detected the possible
chip lock-up situation on the indicated port due to the 82586 anomalies.
The recovery effort of the 82586 DSR succeeded. The 82586 was reset and
restarted, all the outstanding commands were executed and the receiving
operation was resumed.~
1003827~0~Transmit failed.\n~
The transmit operation failed, and a transmit error is returned from the
LAN coprocessor 82586. The error encountered during transmission can be
one of the following:
  1. No Carrier Sense signal during transmission.
  2. Loss of Clear-to-Send signal.
  3. DMA underrun.
  4. Number of collisions exceeding the maximum number of retries.
The transmit error statistics can be found by using the netstat utility.~
1003828~0~Hardware initialization failed on port %d.\n~

pattern matching characters specified in the remote path name. The file name
matching characters on TI System V are *, ?, [..], etc.~
1004081~0~Invalid file characteristics.\n~
The remote file, which the netcp attempted to copy from, carries a file
characteristic which is not supported by the netcp. Normally, this error
indicates that the remote file has one of the special file characteristics
on the remote system, such as program file, image file or key indexed file
on TI990. This is a warning message. The remote file is not copied.~
1004082~0~Append incomplete.\n~
An error was encountered when the netcp attempted to append the source to
the target. Normally, this error indicates that the data packets were out
of order. Please try the netcp command again. If the problem persists,
contact your local TI representative for assistance.~
1004083~0~Record is too long.\n~
A record in the source file is longer than the maximum record length supported 
by netcp. Currently, the maximum record length supported by the netcp is 4096 
bytes. Verify your source file contents.  This problem may be caused by copying
a binary file as a text file.~
1004084~0~Invalid user id and password.\n~
The user id and the password provided by the user is not valid for accessing
the remote system. Verify that the user id and the password have been assigned
on the remote system and that they are specified correctly.~
1004085~0~Bad packet format.\n~
This error indicates that the packet sent from the netcp was in a wrong
format for the network copy server to process. This error should never
happen. Please verify that the netcp and the network copy server are the
latest version. If the problem persists, contact your local TI representative
for assistance.~
1004086~0~Invalid input path name or system errors encountered.\n~
The execution of the remote file can not be started because the remote file
is not valid for execution or an error was occurred when the netexec attempted
to start the execution. Verify that the remote file exists and it is
executable.~
1004087~0~Invalid listing path name.\n~
The listing path name specified in the netexec command is not a valid file name
or one of the directories in the path name does not exist.~
1004088~0~%s is a directory but %s is not.\n~
In directory copy or multiple sources copy, the target exists prior to the
copy and the source and the target have incompatible file characteristics.~
1004089~0~Request time out.\n~
The proper response was not received from the network copy server within
the time-out limit. Currently, the time-out limit is 6 seconds for local
network copy. This error may indicate that the network copy server on the
remote site is not functioning or the network traffic is too busy. Verify
that the remote system and the network copy server are both functioning.
If the problem persists, contact your local TI representative for assistance.~
1004090~0~Invalid Retry value is defined for option -y.\n~
The option y followed by a decimal number defines the desired number of
retries for each request sent by the client.
This error indicates that there is no valid retry count found for option y.
Please issue the command again with the desired retry number specified.~
1004091~0~Can't open any network device in any slot.\n~
There are no high performance Ethernet cards nor is there a device named
/dev/ccbXX/inet found on your local system, where XX is the slot number
of the communications carrier board (CCB). Please make sure at least one CCB
or high performance Ethernet card is installed and configured on your system
and netcp or netexec has permission to access the inet device driver 
corresponding to that CCB or to /dev/xnsidp.~
1004092~0~Odd logical record length.\n~
Odd logical record length is not allowed on the remote system. Please issue
netcp again with an even logical record length specified.~
1004093~0~Directory is full.\n~
The target directory on the remote system cannot be expanded any more to
contain the new entry for the file/subdirectory that is to be copied to
that directory by the netcp. Please make sure the target directory on the
remote system has the proper number of entries available before you do the
netcp again.~

utility to determine which entry number, if any, contains the
desired configuration module.\n~
1004460~0~Configuration module already exists for specified slot.\n~
An attempt to add a configuration module to a configuration partition would
have resulted in an ambiguous configuration partition and is, therefore, not
permitted.  Two configuration modules for the same hardware can exist
in the same configuration partition only if their use is restricted to different
sets of slots. Use cband with the -u (unlink) and -l (link) to limit the
slots the configuration modules are intended to be used for.~

				Invalid parameter
				status = %x, block number = %x\n~
One of the fields in the command block or its associated parameter block(s)
is invalid. One possible cause for this is an attempt to do raw I/O to a
device using a block size that is too large for that device and/or that
density. This may happen more frequently with 1/2" tapes. Some utilities may
expect this error. If the I/O completed normally, this error can be ignored. 
If it did not, please attempt this command again, after first checking the block
size and ensuring that a raw I/O request has a buffer that is longword aligned.\n~
0x413C0084~00~Slot %x, formatter %x, unit %x, slice %x
				Illegal block address
				status = %x, block number = %x\n~
The block number given to the controller in the command block is not valid
for that device. The standard driver knows the size of the disk and should
not cause this error. If you are using the standard driver, try rebooting
the system and reissuing the command. If you are issuing this command to the
controller by hand, please check the block number before attempting to
reissue. If this error occurs often, there may be a system problem.\n~

This is a device hardware error. Try the command again. If this error persists,
you may want to back up everything you can before reformatting the disk or
throwing out the tape. If the problem occurs on an SMD device, it means that
the device was unable to perform a read I/O operation. You will most likely
want to check the drive cables and connectors. It is also possible that the
drive may be unformatted, in which case it will have to be formatted with
the format/verify utility in GDOS.\n~

This is a device hardware error. The ID field of the block cannot be found.
Try the command again. If this error persists, you may want to back up
everything you can before reformatting the disk or throwing out the tape.
If the problem is occurring on a disk drive, use the GDOS Format/Verify
utility to reassign the block or the GDOS Surface Analysis utility and then
the Format/Verify utility if the device that has the error does not support
the Reassign Block command.\n~

				Bad block not found
				status = %x, block number = %x\n~
This is a device hardware error. Try the command again. If this error persists,
you may want to back up everything you can before reformatting the disk or
throwing out the tape. This error message also indicates that the reassign
command was unable to locate the target block to reassign. This means that
the disk is too corrupted to proceed. Back up all data that you can before
using the GDOS Format/Verify utility.\n~

				Format error
				status = %x, block number = %x\n~
The data on this block of the device is ruined and unreadable. A controller
hardware problem may lead to this error. When the data was written to this
block, it was written incorrectly. Take backups of as much of the device as
possible, for you will probably have to reformat the disk to fix the
problem. The probable cause of this is that the parameter logging record
is unreadable. This may also mean that the drive is unformatted in the
first place. Before reformatting with GDOS if the drive is already
formatted and has valid data on it, check all cables in the drive and all
the connectors to the drive. If you still receive this error after
checking the cables, you will have to try to reformat the drive with GDOS.\n~

This is a device hardware error. The controller was unable to read the grown
map from the drive during a format or read defect map command. The drive
most likely has never been formatted. Format using either the vendor or FMT
maps. You should also check all cables and connectors to the drive.\n~
0x413C00CE~00~Slot %x, formatter %x, unit %x, slice %x
				Spare sector not found
				status = %x, block number = %x\n~
This is a device hardware error. The drive has too many localized defects
during a format command. Try issuing the format command again specifying
a larger number of spare sectors per zone. If the error persists, the
number of defects will have to be reduced or the drive is not usable.\n~
#
# The fourth sub-catagory is unknown type errors.
#
0x41490000~00~Slot %x, formatter %x, unit %x, slice %x
				Unknown error code
				status = %x, block number = %x\n~
The controller has returned an error code that the system does not understand.
Try the command again. If this doesn't solve the problem, try rebooting. If
the error happens after rebooting, call your service representative.\n~
0x41490001~00~MSC - Incorrect done address or spurious interrupt\n~
The controller either has not done the done processing or has sent the driver an
interrupt for a request that it never issued. If your I/O got an error, try
the command again. If the problem persists, reboot. If the error
recurs, the controller probably is having hardware difficulties.\n~
0x414900FE~00~Slot %x, formatter %x, unit %x, slice %x
				Internal error
				status = %x, block number = %x\n~
The controller had an internal error. Contact your service representative if
the problem persists. Try to execute the command again.\n~
0x414900FF~00~Slot %x, formatter %x, unit %x, slice %x
				Lost interrupt
				status = %x, block number = %x\n~
The controller has never sent back an interrupt to the driver that said it
finished executing the command. The controller may be confused. Try executing
the command again. If this does not work, reboot the machine. If the problem
persists, consult your hardware manual or your service representative.\n~
0x414C0000~00~Slot %x, formatter %x, unit %x, slice %x
				Unknown I/O error
				status = %x, block number = %x\n~
The error routine in the device driver could not match the error code it was
given by the device. Try the command that caused the error again, and if this
is repeatable, try rebooting the machine. If the problem persists, consult
your hardware manual or your service representative.\n~
0x414C0001~00~Formatter setup to disable/enable timeouts failed\n~
This error usually means that the tape drive is in a confused state. You
should try to reissue the command, and if the error persists, the
system must be rebooted before the tape can be accessed again.\n~
0x414C0002~00~Command terminated abnormally\n~
An ioctl command terminated abnormally. There should be another error listed
before this one. Refer to that error for more information. Attempt the command
again, and if the error persists, the system must be rebooted before the tape
drive can be accessed successfully again.\n~
0x414C0003~00~NUPI setup to disable/enable timeouts failed\n~
This error usually means that the tape drive is in a confused state. You
should try to issue the command again, and if the error persists, the
system must be rebooted before the tape can be accessed again.\n~
0x414C00FE~00~Slot %x, formatter %x, unit %x, slice %x
				Internal error
				status = %x, block number = %x\n~
The controller had an internal error. Contact your service representative if
the problem persists. Try to execute the command again.\n~
0x414C00FF~00~Slot %x, formatter %x, unit %x, slice %x
				Lost interrupt
				status = %x, block number = %x\n~
The controller has never sent back an interrupt to the driver that said it
finished executing the command. The controller may be confused. Try executing
the command again. If this does not work, reboot the machine. If the problem
persists, consult your hardware manual or your service representative.
If the device you are using is a 2-gigabyte tape device, the command being 
executed may take longer than usual or the drive is in a confused state. If you
are unable to issue any further commands to the drive, the system must be
rebooted before the drive can be accessed again.\n~
#
# The fifth sub-catagory is invalid parameters given by the user to the driver.
#
0x415C0000~00~Transfer must be a multiple of 0x%x\n~
You have attempted to do raw I/O with an invalid transfer size. The transfer
size for our supported controllers for all devices except 1/2" tapes is
1K byte or a multiple of 1K bytes. Try the command again using a valid
transfer size.\n~
0x415C0001~00~Buffer not aligned on word boundary\n~
You are attempting to do raw I/O to a buffer that is not aligned on a long
word boundary. Since raw I/O eliminates a copy being put in kernel space
before being transferred to your program's space, your space must be on a long
word boundary. The controller cannot do DMA to any space not on a word boundary.
Align your buffer on the correct boundary and try the request again.\n~
0x415C0002~00~Slot %x is an invalid slot number\n~
Your minor device number contained an invalid field for the slot number portion
of the device number. Check your device numbers and make sure they are correct.
Make certain that there is a controller in the slot specified in the device
number.\n~
0x415C0003~00~In slot %x there is no controller\n~
The minor device number of the device that you are attempting to communicate
with has a slot number field where there is no controller present. Use
device manager to make the correct nodes. If there is a controller in that
slot, make sure it is fully connected to the back plane and passes its
self-tests.\n~
0x415C0004~00~Slot %x, formatter %x, unit %x, slice %x
					Bad unit or block number\n~
The unit number of the minor device number of the device you are accessing is
invalid. Check the device number and make sure that there is a device at that
location.\n~
0x415C0005~00~Slot %x, formatter %x, unit %x
					Seek forward before write error\n~
This error is reported by 1/4" tapes if you are attempting to write a block
that is actually less than 1k. Tar with an odd block size will do this, even
without using raw I/O. You are writing a partial block, rewinding, seeking
forward, then writing the rest of the block. Always make sure that you are
writing full blocks of 1k when writing to cartridge tape, for this is strictly
a sequential device.\n~
0x415C0006~00~High-density 1/2" tape transfer size greater than 32K\n~
The half-inch tape device only supports block sizes of less than or equal to
32K bytes if high-density (3200 bpi) format is used. Please reduce your request
size to 32K bytes or less.\n~
0x415C0007~00~Medium-density 1/2" tape transfer size greater than 64K\n~
The half-inch tape device only supports block sizes of less than or equal to
64K bytes if medium density (1600bpi) format is used. Please reduce your
request size to 64K bytes or less.\n~
0x415C0008~00~Writing to tape in QIC11 format is not supported\n~
The quarter-inch tape drive only supports writes with QIC24 density. Tapes may
be read that were previously written in QIC11, but tapes cannot be created in
QIC11.\n~
0x415C0009~00~Medium density 1/2" tape write size greater than 32K\n~
The half-inch tape device only supports block sizes of less than or equal to
32K bytes if writing in medium density (1600bpi) format. Please reduce your
request size to 32K bytes or less.\n~
0x415C000A~00~6250 density 1/2" tape transfer size greater than 32K\n~
The half-inch tape device only supports block sizes of less than or equal to
32K bytes if 6250 density (6250bpi) format is used. Please reduce your
request size to 32k bytes or less.\n~
0x415C000B~00~Transfer size greater than 32K on a CT2000\n~
The CT2000 tape device only supports block sizes of less than or equal to 32K
bytes. Please reduce your request size to 32K bytes or less.\n~
0x415C000C~00~Slot %x, formatter %x, unit %x
				Seek forward before write error\n~
This error is reported by the CT2000 tape drive because the drive does not
have that functionality. This message will appear usually if you are attempting
to write a block that is less than 1K to the block device. When using the block
device node for the CT2000 tape drive, be sure to only write in multiples of
1K byte.\n~
0x416C0000~00~Cannot find device %x in table for close of multivolume\n~
This is an internal error in the multivolume file system driver. The close
to the multivolume file system failed. In order to close the file system, the
system must be rebooted.\n~
0x416C0001~00~Part number for board in slot %x is not in multidevs structure\n~
The board in the slot listed does not have an entry in conf.c and, therefore,
cannot be used as part of the multivolume file system. Add the correct entry,
and then this board and its associated driver may be used as part of the
multivolume file system.\n~
0x416C0002~00~Cannot find device %x for multivolume file system in strategy\n~
This is an internal error to the multivolume file system driver. This error
should not occur. If it does, the problem should be reported to your customer 
support representative, and you should refrain from using the file system 
causing the error.\n~
0x416C0003~00~Multivolume device %x not found in table for read request\n~
This is an internal error to the multivolume file system driver. This error
should not occur. If it does, the problem should be reported to your customer 
support representative, and you should refrain from using the file system 
causing the error.\n~
0x416C0004~00~Multivolume device %x not found in table for write request\n~
This is an internal error to the multivolume file system driver. This error
should not occur. If it does, the problem should be reported to your customer 
support representative, and you should refrain from using the file system 
causing the error.\n~
0x416C0005~00~Too many open logical partitions - cannot open device %x\n~
There is a limit to the number of multivolume file systems that can be open at
one time. Currently that number is 10. Close one of the open multivolume file
systems, and open the multivolume file system that you want open.\n~
0x416C0006~00~Error occurred on the open of the anchor partition - device %x\n~
The open to the anchor partition failed. Either the device that the anchor is
on had a hardware error or is offline. Along with this error was most likely an
error from the driver that was doing the open. Look at that error to get more
information.\n~
0x416C0007~00~Error occurred while reading the anchor partition - device %x\n~
A read to the anchor partition failed, most likely with a hardware error.
Along with this error was most likely an error from the driver issuing the read.
Look at that error message to get more information.\n~
0x416C0008~00~Device %x does not look like an anchor partition\n~
The device you said contained the anchor partition does not have the correct
header information. Check the device number to be sure it is correct and
contains the right information as to the location of the anchor.\n~
0x416C0009~00~Error getting dev# of device in slot %x,unit %x,part %c%c%c%c\n~
The driver for the board in the above slot did not successfully return a device
number when given the slot, unit, and partition name above. An error of some
sort occurred in the driver when calculating this number. There should be an
associated driver error with this error. Look at that error for more info.\n~
0x416C000A~00~Open failed for part of multivolume in slot %x,unit %x,
							partition %c%c%c%c\n~
The open to the device listed above failed. Either there was a hardware error on
the device, or perhaps the device was offline. See the associated error
message if there is one from the driver for further information.\n~
0x416C000B~00~Error obtaining length of device %x\n~
There was a hardware error that occurred while attempting to get the length of
the partition with the above device number. Most likely this is caused by a
hardware error. Please see the error message above this one in errpt to obtain
further information.\n~
0x416C000C~00~Too many physical partitions in a logical one.\n~
There is a current limit of 255 physical partitions in a single multivolume
file system. This limit corresponds to the maximum number of devices that can
be open at any one time. Lower the number of physical partitions in your
multivolume file system.\n~
0x416C000D~00~Error reading volume label on unit %x for multivolume open\n~
A hardware error occurred when reading the volume label of the above unit.
Using errpt, find the message above this one to find further information on
the type of error that occurred.\n~
0x416C000E~00~Error reading partition table on unit %x for multivolume open\n~
A hardware error occurred when reading the partition table of the given unit.
Using errpt, find the message above this one to find further information on
the type of error that occurred.\n~
0x416C000F~00~Error opening unit %x to read partition table\n~
An error occurred on the open to the listed unit. The error above this in the
log file will most likely give you more information on what went wrong during
the open. If there is no associated error, check the connections to the drive
and make sure that they are secure.\n~
0x416C0010~00~Partition %c%c%c%c not found on logical unit %x\n~
On the open to the multivolume file system, the partition name listed above
was supposed to be a part of the file system. The partition was not found on
the unit listed. You may have moved your disk, or reorganized it and changed
the partition name. Use devadm to reconfigure your multivolume file system if
necessary.\n~
0x416C0011~00~Invalid command given to mscinfo\n~
The command given to the MSC driver was not a recognizable command. This is
most likely an internal error to the multivolume file system driver. Report
the problem to your customer support representative.\n~
0x416C0012~00~Invalid command given to npinfo\n~
The command given to the NUPI driver was not a recognizable command. This is
most likely an internal error to the multivolume file system driver. Report
the problem to your customer support representative.\n~

# Errors for mirroring
#
0x41860000~00~Open of alternate mirror band failed - dev = %x\n~
The open of the alternate mirror band failed. This is only a warning and this
message alone will not cause the entire open to fail. Check your alternate
mirror band to see if it has been moved; if so, use devadm to repair the
default mirror band entry that points to the alternate mirror band.~
0x41860001~00~Error reading alternate anchor-dev = %x. Default will be used.\n~
The read of the alternate mirror band failed. Check the previous device error
to determine the cause of the read failure. This is a warning message and will
not cause the open of the mirror to fail unless there is a later problem.~
0x41860002~00~Alternate mirror band not initialized - dev = %x\n~
The alternate mirror band entry points to a currently uninitialized mirror
band. To initialize it, devadm must be run to remove and redefine the alternate
mirror band entry in the default mirror band. This is a warning message and the
open of the mirror device will continue by using the default mirror band only.~
0x41860003~00~Alt mirror band does not exist or is BAD - using default %x\n~
The alternate mirror band either does not exist and no entry for one exists
in the default, or the alternate entry in the default mirror band has a flag
value of BAD. If no alternate is desired, this message can be ignored. If the
alternate needs repairing, use devadm to remove and redefine it.~
0x41860004~00~Default mirror band marked BAD - alt is used - dev %x\n~
The entry in the alternate mirror band for the default mirror band has a flag
value of BAD. Use devadm on the alternate mirror band to remove and redefine
the mirror band entry in the alternate to repair the default mirror band.~
0x41860005~00~One mirror entry marked BAD - dev = %x
              Continuing unmirrored with other entry.\n~
One of the partition entries in the mirror band has a flag value of BAD or
failed the open. The open will complete if this is the only error, but the
partition will not be mirrored until mkmirr is run.~
0x41860006~00~One mirror entry marked ACTIVE - dev = %x
              Continuing unmirrored with other entry.\n~
One of the partition entries in the mirror band has a flag value of ACTIVE.
This usually means that the file system was doing I/O when the system went
down. If only one is ACTIVE, mkmirr must be run to repair the mirror before
it can again be mirrored. This error alone will not fail the open.~
0x41860007~00~Attempting to open BAD root file system - dev %x
              First mirror entry used.\n~
The root file system has both entries marked BAD, but extra effort is made
to complete the open or the system will not boot. The root file system will
not be mirrored until mkmirr is run, and it is advisable to repair the root
file system as soon as possible. For any other file system, the open would have
failed if both entries were BAD. The first entry will be used for root.~
0x41860008~00~Attempting to open ACTIVE root file system - dev %x
              First mirror entry used.\n~
The root file system has both entries marked ACTIVE, but extra effort is made
to complete the open or the system will not boot. The root file system will
not be mirrored until mkmirr is run, and it is advisable to repair the root
file system as soon as possible. For any other file system, the open would have
failed if both entries were ACTIVE. The first entry will be used for root.~
0x41860009~00~Attempting to open ACTIVE root file system - dev %x
              Second mirror entry used.\n~
The root file system has both entries marked ACTIVE, but extra effort is made
to complete the open or the system will not boot. The root file system will
not be mirrored until mkmirr is run, and it is advisable to repair the root
file system as soon as possible. For any other file system, the open would have
failed if both entries were ACTIVE. The second entry will be used for root.~
0x4186000A~00~The root file system will NOT be mirrored until repaired.\n~
This simply reinforces that the root file system will no longer be mirrored
until mkmirr is run to reestablish the mirrors.~
0x4186000B~00~Closed device %x not in open table.\n~
This usually indicates a problem with the mirror driver itself or corrupted
kernel data. Because this was found on a close, the problem is not fatal.~
0x4186000C~00~Entry not marked ACTIVE - write proceeding for device %x\n~
During a write request, the mirror band could not be updated correctly and
therefore the entries were not marked as being ACTIVE with outstanding I/O.
This implies that the mirror band now contains incorrect flag values for the
entries and could lead to possible corruption if these flags are not repaired.
The cause for the update problem of the mirror band should be listed above, and
this is what needs to be fixed.~
0x4186000D~00~Entry %x not marked BAD - update with devadm - device %x\n~
The update to the mirror band failed and the entry that should be marked as
BAD was not. The mirror band now contains invalid information and needs to be
updated with devadm by changing to BAD, the flag value of the entry number
given in the error. If this is not done, corruption can occur.~
0x4186000E~00~Mirror band for device %x could not be updated.\n~
The mirror band could not be updated to properly reflect the state of the
entries. Therefore, the default mirror band will be marked BAD in the alternate,
and only the alternate will be used. To repair the default, use devadm on the
alternate to remove and redefine the default once the hardware problem with
the default is resolved.~
0x4186000F~00~Alternate mirror band for device %x could not be updated.\n~
The alternate mirror band could not be updated to reflect the state of the
entries. The alternate entry will be marked BAD in the default until devadm
is used to redefine the alternate after the hardware problem is resolved.
Meanwhile, only the default mirror band will be used.~
0x41860010~00~All mirror bands for device %x contain invalid data.\n~
Neither mirror band could be updated to reflect the proper state of the
partition entries. The mirror bands need to be repaired as soon as possible
after fixing the hardware problems that caused the errors when writing the 
mirror bands. No further writes to the mirrored partition should be done until 
at least one mirror band is marked as GOOD and can be updated without error.~
0x41860011~00~Alternate mirror band does not refer to default
              Alternate will not be used - dev = %x\n~
The alternate mirror band does not point back to the default mirror band.
Somehow the mirror bands are corrupted. Use devadm to repair the alternate
entry by removing and redefining it.~
0x41860012~00~Unable to allocate system memory for Open Mirror Table\n~
The mirror driver could not allocate enough system memory to build the
Open Mirror Table. Either some kernel data is corrupted or the system is
out of memory. No mirrors can be opened until this memory can be allocated.~
0x41860013~00~Mirrored swap device partitions do not match in size and swap
              will not be mirrored.\n~
The two partitions that comprise the mirrored swap device are not the same size.
This is only a warning. The system will continue to operate, but the swap
device will not be mirrored. To correct the problem, use the ptu utility
to make the two partitions the same size. You must then reboot in order for
the swap device to be mirrored.~
0x41860014~00~I/O Error on write to a mirrored device.
Mirror entry receiving error has been marked BAD - dev = 0x%x.
Continuing unmirrored with the other mirror entry.\n~
An I/O error occured on a write to one side of a mirrored device. That 
mirror entry has been marked as BAD and will no longer be used.
The good side of the mirror will continued to be used unmirrored
until mkmirr is run to remake the mirror.~
0x418C0000~00~Too many open mirrored file systems - internal table full.\n~
There is an internal limit inside the mirror driver for the number of mirrors
that can be open at any one time, and this limit has been reached.~
0x418C0001~00~Error determining controller type of mirror band - dev = %x\n~
The device number for the mirror band does not seem to contain a valid slot
number of a controller. If you have an alternate mirror band for this mirror,
use the alternate path name. Otherwise, you should redefine your mirror band
with devadm if you have moved the disk controller.~
0x418C0002~00~Open error on mirror band device - dev = %x\n~
The open to the mirror band failed for some reason, such as the device was not
ready or the partition could not be found. Check to see if a device error
appears before this one. If you have an alternate mirror band, use the path
name of the alternate to open the mirror.~
0x418C0003~00~Error reading mirror band - dev = %x\n~
This error should have a preceding device error. See that error for more
information on the actual problem. If you have an alternate mirror band for
this mirror device, you may use that path name to open the mirror.~
0x418C0004~00~Mirror band is not initialized - dev = %x\n~
An open attempt was made on a mirror band that was not initialized and does
not contain entries for the partitions to be mirrored. Devadm must be used
to set up the mirror band before it can be opened.~
0x418C0005~00~No valid mirror bands. Unable to open dev %x\n~
Neither the default nor the alternate mirror bands were valid and therefore
the open fails. Check the errors or warnings for the open of individual mirror 
bands to determine the exact problem. You will most likely need to set up the 
mirror bands again using devadm.~
0x418C0006~00~Both mirror entries marked BAD for dev %x\n~
Neither entry in the mirror band pointed to a partition in a valid state. It
is possible that both opens to the partitions failed for some reason listed
in previous errors, or the flags for both entries were marked as BAD. Devadm
and mkmirr must be run to reestablish the mirror.~
0x418C0007~00~One entry marked BAD and one ACTIVE. Unable to open dev %x\n~
One of the mirror band entries is marked BAD and one ACTIVE. The open fails
because neither of the entries is marked GOOD and the driver does not know
which one to use. Devadm must be used to change the state of one entry to GOOD
and mkmirr must be run before the partition is again mirrored.~
0x418C0008~00~Both mirror entries marked ACTIVE for dev %x\n~
Both entries in the mirror band are marked ACTIVE and the mirror driver cannot
determine which to use. This is most likely a result of a crash condition while
I/O was active for the mirror. You should change the state flag of one of the
entries to GOOD, then run mkmirr to remirror the partitions.~
0x418C0009~00~Entry sizes are not equal - Cannot open dev %x\n~
The sizes of the partitions composing the mirror must be equal or mirroring
cannot take place. Please modify your partition sizes to be equal in length
for both entries.~
0x418C000A~00~Device not found in open table - dev = %x\n~
A command was done to a mirrored device that the mirror driver does not believe
is open. This typically suggests an internal mirror driver bug or corrupted
kernel data. Try rebooting the machine.~
0x418C000B~00~Read to both mirror entries failed for device %x\n~
A read failed because both partitions composing the mirror received an error
while attempting to complete the read. Check the device errors listed before
this error for the cause of the read failures.~
0x418C000C~00~Write to both mirror entries failed for device %x\n~
Both writes to mirror entries failed, causing the write request from the OS
to fail. Check the device errors listed before this error for the cause of
the write failures.~
0x418C000D~00~Both mirror entries marked BAD in read for device %x\n~
Both mirror entries have a flag value of BAD so the read cannot complete. The
mirror flags for one entry must be changed to GOOD before any reads can be
done and mkmirr must be run before the partition can again be mirrored.~
0x418C000E~00~GET_LENGTH command needs open device\n~
This is usually an internal driver error or an example of corrupted kernel
data. The device passed to an internal driver routine was not found in the
table of open devices. Attempt the command again, and if it fails, reboot.~
0x418C000F~00~Invalid request given to mirinfo\n~
An undefined request was given to an internal driver routine. This is usually
caused by corrupted kernel data or an internal driver problem. Reissue the
command and if the problem persists, try rebooting the machine.~
