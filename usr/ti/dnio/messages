reduce the number of transport sessions, or reduce the number of device drivers
downloaded to the CCB.~
1004784~0~Error transferring data to network buffer.\n~
This error can be caused by a shortage of CCB network buffer space. If this 
error happens regularly, reduce the number of transport sessions, or reduce the
number of device drivers downloaded to the CCB.~
1004785~0~Invalid Name Manager operation code: %x.\n~
This is an internal error. Report it to your system administrator.~
1004786~0~No matching pending operation.\n~
This is an internal error. report it to your system administrator.~

the cache.~
1004788~0~The site name was set.\n~~
1004789~0~Cannot map sitename to address.\n~
The name manager attempted to map the specified site name to a network address,
but no site with the specified site name responded.~
1004790~0~Cannot map address to sitename.\n~
The name manager attempted to map the specified address to a site name, but no 
site with the specified address responded.~
1004791~0~The name manager received a bad response packet.\n~
A name manager request was returned in error. This may be an error at the site 
whose name is the site name requested. If this happens consistently, report the
problem to your system administrator.~
1004792~0~Error getting network buffer.\n~
The buffer pool in the CCB is exhausted. If this error happens regularly, 
reduce the number of transport sessions, or reduce the number of device drivers
downloaded to the CCB.~
1004793~0~Name manager not ready.\n~
The name manager received a request before it had set the local site name or 
initialized its internal tables. Make sure that the DNIO/1500 System V start-up
script (/etc/dnio1500init) is getting executed from the download script 
(/etc/download).~
1004794~0~Lost a pending request.\n~
This is an internal error and should be reported to your system administrator.~
1004795~0~Heap exhausted.\n~
The name manager was unable to allocate an internal structure. This may not be 
fatal. The likely result of this error is that a name will not get cached, 
slowing the next access to that name, but the error will not interfere with 
normal operation of DNIO/1500 System V. However, if this error happens fairly 
often, the error should be reported to your system administrator.~
