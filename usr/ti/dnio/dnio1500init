# If there is a value for the environment variable 'NIOPATH', nios990 will
# prefix a received pathname with the value of the environment variable
# 'NIOPATH', if there has not been a previous substitution done for the
# first element of the received pathname.  The first element of a received
# pathname can be replaced with the value of an environment variable if the
# first element of the received pathname does not start with a '.' or '/'
# character.  If you want to restrict network access to a specific directory,
# set the environment variable NIOPATH to the name of the directory and
# advise users about the restriction.  If you want to restrict network
# users to a set of directories, identify names and values for those names
# and inform users of the additional names.
#
# example:
#
# NIOPATH=/usr	  Restricts network access to '/usr' directory
# export NIOPATH
