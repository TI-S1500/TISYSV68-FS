		@(#)lexical.sh	1.1 87/03/09

	The Lexical Commands Menu lists tools used to create
	   source files for lexical analyzers and parsers.

	Lexical analyzers find patterns in a program and convert 
	   these patterns into meaningful values or tokens.  Parsers 
	   are to convert meaningful sequences of tokens and values 
	   into actions.
