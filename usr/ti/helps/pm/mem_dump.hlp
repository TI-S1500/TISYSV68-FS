The Memory Map screens display a physical memory map for a particular CPU.
Memory on the map is broken into pages of 4096 bytes (4K bytes). Each line 
on the memory map contains a physical address followed by the status and 
usage of each of the 69 memory pages beginning at that address. The following 
symbols are used to indicate the usage of each memory page:

    .(period) - Free page

    d    - Shared data page

    D    - Data page

    K    - System kernel page

    B    - Buffer cache page

    m    - Shared memory

    s    - Shared stack page

    S    - Stack page

    t    - Shared text page

    T    - Text page

Several screens are displayed for each memory map. Use the + and - commands to 
display the next and previous screens. Blank lines appear at the end of a 
memory map to indicate the end of physical memory for the current CPU. To view 
the memory map for a different CPU, first access the CPU screen by slot number
(0-f), then use the m command to display the memory map for that CPU.
