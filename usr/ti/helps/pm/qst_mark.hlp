PM uses the following commands in the interactive mode to collect and display 
performance information on various system components:

    0-9, a-f Display the CPU, CCB, or Disk Controller screen, as 
             appropriate, for the processor in the specified system slot
             number. (The slot numbers are in hexadecimal format; a-f 
             refers to slot numbers 10-15.)

	    u   At the CPU screen, u will display the disk controller screen
                if there is a CPU and disk controller in the same slot, which
	        occurs in 68040 NuBus (TM) boards. 

    g   Displays the General Information screen in the last selected format.

	    At the General Information screen, The following upper case
	    commands may be used:

    	    C   Display only the CPUs' bar graphs.

    	    D   Display only the disk controllers' (NPI, MSC, and NP2) bar 
	        graphs.

            N   Display only the communication carrier boards' (CCB) bar
	        graphs.

            S   Display all bar graphs in slot order from lowest to highest
	        slot, unless overriden by PM control file.  

    	    G   Display all bar graphs grouped by functionality.

    i   Displays the BusNet I/O Activity screen.

    l   Displays the Process Linear Address ID screens for the current CPU.

            At an ID screen, enter the process ID for a particular process to 
            display the Process Linear Address Space screen for the specified 
            process.

    m   Displays the Memory Map screens for the current CPU.

    n   Displays the Network Statistics screen for the current CCB.

            l   At the Network Statistics screen, l### displays the Local 
                Terminal Concentrator (TC) screen for the TC specified by 
                ### (leading zeros are required).

    p   Displays the Configurable Parameters screens for the system.

    s   Displays the System Slot Configuration screen for the system.

    t   Displays the System Totals screens for the current CPU.

    v   Displays the Virtual Memory Subsystem screens for the current CPU.

    w   Displays the System Wide Activity screen for the system.
    
PM uses the following commands to perform certain utility functions in
the interactive mode:

    +/- Display the next/previous screen if performance information 
        collected by a command is presented on more than one screen.

    ?   Displays a general help screen which lists the foreground commands.
        
            q  Enter q to exit the General Help screen, and returns to the
               last performance screen displayed.

    h   Displays a Help screen that is specific to the information 
        currently displayed on the screen.  

            ?  Lists the keys to control the display of a Help screen.

            F1/F2  Display the next/previous Help screen if help information 
                   is presented on more than one screen.

            q  Enter q to exit a Help screen, and returns to the last 
               performance screen displayed.

    r   Displays the Change PM Sample Rate screen.  

            The up arrow or k      At the sample rate screen, increases the
                                   sample rate in increments of 1 second.
            The down arrow or j    At the sample rate screen, decreases the
                                   sample rate in increments of 1 second.
            q  Enter q to exit a Sample Rate screen, and returns to the last
               performance screen displayed.

    q   Quits the interactive mode and returns to the system prompt.


    right arrow   At the General Information screen, if there are more than 
                  16 bar graphs and there are more bar graphs on the right, 
                  the right arrow key will move the display one bar graph
                  to the right.

    left arrow    At the General Information screen, if there are more than 
                  16 bar graphs and there are more bar graphs on the left, 
                  the left arrow key will move the display one bar graph to 
	          the left.


NOTE: If PM is sleeping (between sample times) when you press a command key, 
there might be a delay before PM acts upon the command. PM will detect the 
command key and carry out the command as soon as it wakes up to collect and 
display the next sample. The maximum delay will be equal to the sample rate.


PM control File:

PM looks for an environment variable PM_CONTROL which points to a PM
control file.  The file name may be an absolute pathname or a relative
pathname.  If it is relative, it is relative to the user's home directory,
and not the current working directory.

   If the PM control file contains the following:

        General Screen Order: xxxxxxxxxxx

   where the x's are the slot numbers in hexidecimal in the order desired,
   then that order will be used by "S" command and will be default when PM
   is first activated.
