PM uses the following commands in the interactive mode to collect and display 
performance information on various system components:

    0-9, a-f Display the CPU, CCB, or Disk Controller screen, as 
             appropriate, for the processor in the specified system slot
             number. (The slot numbers are in hexadecimal format; a-f 
             refers to slot numbers 10-15.)

             At the Disk Controller screen, l### displays the extended disk 
             statistics screens for the logical disk drive specified by 
             ### (leading zeros are required). This command is available 
             only if the system kernel tracks the statistics presented on 
             these screens.

    r   Resets the counters on the extended disk statistics screens.

    g   Displays the General Information screen.

    i   Displays the BusNet I/O Activity screen.

    l   Displays the Process Linear Address ID screens for the current CPU.
        At an ID screen, enter the process ID for a particular process to 
        display the Process Linear Address Space screen for the specified 
        process.

    m   Displays the Memory Map screens for the current CPU.

    n   Displays the Network Statistics screen for the current CCB.

    l   At the Network Statistics screen, l### displays the Local Terminal 
        Concentrator (TC) screen for the TC specified by ### (leading zeros 
        are required).

    p   Displays the Configurable Parameters screens for the system.

    s   Displays the NuBus Slot Configuration screen for the system.

    t   Displays the System Totals screens for the current CPU.

    v   Displays the Virtual Memory Subsystem screens for the current CPU.

    w   Displays the System#wide Activity screen for the system.
    
PM uses the following commands to perform certain utility functions:

    +/- Display the next/previous screen if performance information 
        collected by a command is presented on more than one screen.

    ?   Displays a general help screen that lists the foreground commands.
        Return or q Exits the general help screen, and returns to the last 
        performance screen displayed.

    h   Displays a help screen that is specific to the information 
        currently displayed on the screen.  F1/F2 Display the next/previous 
        help screen if help information is presented on more than one screen.
        Return or q Exits a help screen, and returns to the last performance 
        screen displayed.

    r   Displays the Change PM Sample Rate screen.  The up arrow or "k" 
        increases the sample rate in increments of one second. The down
        arrow or "j" decreases the sample rate in increments of one second.
        Return or "q" Exits the Sample Rate screen, and returns to the last 
        performance screen displayed.

    q   Quits the interactive mode and returns to the system prompt.

NOTE: If PM is sleeping (between sample times) when you press a command key, 
there might be a delay before PM acts upon the command. PM will detect the 
command key and carry out the command as soon as it wakes up to collect and 
display the next sample. The maximum delay will be equal to the sample rate.
