	sccs - Source Code Control System Menu
		@(#)sccs.sh	1.1 87/03/09

	This menu lists tools which create, maintain, and control special 
	   files called SCCS files.  

	The SCCS commands let the user create and store multiple versions 
	   of a program or document in a single file, instead of having 
	   one file for each version.  They allow the user to retrieve any 
	   version at any time, make changes to this version, and save the 
	   changes as a new version of the file.
