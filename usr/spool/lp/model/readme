	USING tr78 AND tr87 TO TRANSLATE TEXT FOR PRINTERS


This document gives an example of how filters can be set up to automatically
translate text among the various 7-bit national character sets and the 8-bit
ISO 8859/1 set.

These filters rely upon the "tr78" and "tr87" shell scripts to actually
translate the text.  "tr78" translates from the 7-bit national character sets
to ISO 8859/1.  "tr87" translates from ISO 8859/1 to the 7-bit character sets. 
For both scripts, a single command line parameter from the table below (e.g. 
fr) specifies which 7-bit national character set is intended.

    fr		France
    gr		Germany
    nd or dn	Norway and Denmark
    sp		Spain
    sv		Sweden
    sw		Switzerland
    uk		United Kingdom
    us		United States


Printers that accept character sets of a specific nationality should have the
nationality defined in in the printer's content-type-list.  For example, a
printer which assumes that input is in the German national character set would
be defined as follows:

	/usr/lib/lpadmin -p lp1 -I gr . . .

For each national character set for which a printer exists, an lp filter must
be created.  This us done using the lpfilter command.  For example:

	/usr/lib/lpfilter -f iso8859_gr -F filter-def-filename

    where filter-def-filename is a file containing the following text:

	Input types:	iso8859
	Output types:	gr
	Filter type:	fast
	Command:	/usr/spool/lp/model/tr87 gr


A printer which accepts ISO 8859/1 text would be defined as follows:

	/usr/lib/lpadmin -p lp2 -I iso8859 . . .


Filters may also be required to translate incomming text from national formats
into iso8859/1 format.  For example, if the system sometimes handles text
in the French national character set, the following filter would be required:

	/usr/lib/lpfilter -f fr_iso8859 -F filter-def-filename

    where filter-def-filename is a file containing the following text:

	Input types:	fr
	Output types:	iso8859
	Filter type:	fast
	Command:		/usr/spool/lp/model/tr78 fr


Now, to print text in the French character set on the printer lp1, which was
defined to handle the German character set, the user would simply use the "-T"
option of the "lp" command, as follows:

	lp -T fr -d lp1 <text-file>

The "lp" utility would automatically pass the text through the "fr_iso8859"
filter, then through the "iso8859_gr" filter before giving it to the printer.

If the text were in ISO 8859/1 format, the following form of the "lp" command
would be used:

	lp -T iso8859 -d lp1 <text-file>

The "lp" utility would automatically pass the text through the "iso9959-gr"
filter.
