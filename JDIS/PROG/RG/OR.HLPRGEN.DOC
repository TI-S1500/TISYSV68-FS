SR     PCS Report Generator - Sort Specification Help
SR *********************************************************************
SR
SR The SORT function applies to all reports and extracts.  It is used to
SR describe the sequence in which data will be presented in the report.
SR The format is :
SR
SR                           File Name     Field Name  N/O
SR
SR    REPORT SEQUENCE 1 :    CUSTOMER      NUMBER       N
SR    REPORT SEQUENCE 2 :    ORDER         NUMBER       N
SR
SR This report will appear in CUSTOMER NUMBER then ORDER NUMBER
SR sequence.  N is Normal (Ascending), O is Opposite (descending).
SR
SR When sorting is not specified, the report will appear in the same
SR sequence as the "master" file.  Sorting is a fairly time-consuming
SR task and should be specified only when it contributes to the
SR meaningfulness of a report when input files are large.

BK     PCS Report Generator - Break Specification Help
BK*********************************************************************
BK
BK Break specifications are used to define print format spacing. Breaks
BK are independent of total breaks which are defined as part of totals.
BK
BK When a break field changes value, the report is spaced by the number
BK of lines given in the break specification.
BK
BK For example :  CUSTOMER NUMBER   3
BK                CUSTOMER REGION   P
BK
BK would cause triple spacing when customer number changes and a new
BK page when region changes.  When more than one condition applies, the
BK greater break value prevails.
BK
BK Valid break values are 1-72 lines and P (new page).

SC     PCS Report Generator - Selective Computation Help
SC *********************************************************************
SC
SC Seelctive compuations are syntactically combinations of select and
SC compute statements.  Selective computations are IF <condition> then
SC <do something>.  While selection specifications cause entire records
SC to be included into the report, selective computations cause only
SC the items defined to be operated on after a record has been selected.
SC
SC The format is :  IF...  (same as selection specification)
SC                  AND    (optional, same as in selection)
SC                   <result> ... (same as computation)
SC
SC Each of the statements may occur any number of times.

CP *********************************************************************
CP     PCS Report Generator - Computation Specification Help
CP *********************************************************************
CP
CP Computation fields are fields which do not exist on your data files.
CP The computed fields are always on the file WORK and therefore the
CP screen does not prompt you for the 1st file name, it is set to WORK.
CP
CP The specification is <result> = <operand 1> <operation> <operand 2>
CP
CP Result is a field name which must exist on your WORK file.  Operand 1
CP is any file/field.  Operations are * / + -.  Operand 2 is a
CP file/field or a numeric literal.
CP
CP Computations require that the result and each operand be numeric.
CP The exception to this is when computation is used to MOVE the value
CP of operand 1 into the result field.  In that case there is neither
CP an operation code nor an operand 2.  Result and operand 1 must be
CP of the same general format, both must be any A/N format or both must
CP be any numeric format.  Note that ALL date formats are treated as
CP A/N for all specifications even though their actual value may be
CP numeric.  Numeric value types are any 9x data type.

TO FIELD TO BE TOTALLED   PRINT ON CHANGE   Col   Accum
TO                        EDIT   LEVEL     LABEL              LABEL COL
TO CUSTOMER OUTSTANDING   CUSTOMER NUMBER    20    N
TO                                         Total For Customer =  1
TO
TO FIELD TO BE TOTALLED is the field whose value will be summed.
TO   When this field is the same in two subsequent totals, then those
TO   totals are printed on the same line, else totals go on new line.
TO PRINT ON CHANGE is the field which will act as the break to trigger
TO   the printing of this total value.  When no value is entered, this
TO   is treated as a grand total (which are defined separately).
TO Col is the column in which the total will be printed.  Pressing enter
TO   without entering the value will cause the system to assign the
TO   column so that the total lines up with the field being totalled.
TO Accum denotes whether the value is to be reset after printing or
TO   whether the value is to be a running total.  Default = N (reset)
TO EDIT.  Noramlly a total is printed using the same edit mask as the
TO   field being totalled.  If a larger mask is needed, enter value here
TO LEVEL value 1-9.  A break at a given level will force a break at any
TO   break level with a larger number (forces subtotals) (see manual)
SL *********************************************************************
SL     PCS Report Generator - Selection Specification Help
SL *********************************************************************
SL
SL Selection criteria are used to determine if a data record is to be
SL included in the report.  If this is a multifile report, then
SL selection is used to determine if 1 set of records is to be included.
SL
SL Selection is defined by one or more IF (/AND) specifications.
SL Each IF statement is treated as an OR, each IF and the AND's after
SL it are treated as one criterion.   For example :
SL
SL     IF  CUSTOMER BALANCE  GT 1000
SL     AND CUSTOMER LIMIT    LE 500
SL     IF  CUSTOMER STATUS   EQ WORK FLAG
SL
SL is evaluated : Select this record if (Cust Balance > 1000 and
SL                                       Cust Limit <= 500)
SL                                   OR  Cust Status = Flag
SL The second operand may be a field, a literal, a query value or a
SL synonym.  A literal must be in single quotes if the 1st field is A/N,
SL not in quotes if 1st field is numeric.  A query value is entered as
SL @Q.  A synonym is entered '~SYN' or '%SYN' for A/N and numeric syns
SL respectively.  SYN is the name of a synonym.

IN     PCS Report Generator - Initialization Specification Help
IN *********************************************************************
IN
IN Initialization specifications is used to define any process which
IN needs to occur before the report starts.  This includes two main
IN functions : assign values to WORK items and position files.
IN
IN Assigning a value : WORK <field> <operand2>  N
IN  This causes the value of operand 2 to be move to the WORK field.
IN  Operand 2 may be a field or a literal, the Read column must be N.
IN
IN Positioning files : This entails either skipping 1 or more records :
IN
IN    CUSTOMER <any field>         Y    causes 1 record to be skipped
IN    CUSTOMER <key field>  @Q     S/E  will cause a prompt for the
IN                                  value of <key field> at report run
IN                                  time. S means start when key GE, E
IN                                  means end when key GE.
IN
IN  For compound keys, you may query the components (Read=N), then move
IN  the actual key field to itself (program requires an operand 2 value)
IN  and specify Read = S (or Read = E to end).

GN LINES PER PAGE - lines per page.
GN
GN SUPPRESS REPEATS - causes columns with values identical to correspon-
GN  ding values on the prior line to be suppressed (spaced).  Values are
GN  Y/N/1-n.  Yes means suppress any/all.  N means do not suppress.  1-n
GN  is the column of the last field to be eligible for suppression.
GN
GN SUPPRESS BLANK LINES - when a line contains no data due to suppress
GN  or is all blank, a Y will cause no blank line to be printed.
GN
GN REPORT DESCRIPTION - enter text here, it will be displayed on the

EX     PCS Report Generator - Extract Specification Help
EX *********************************************************************
EX
EX Extract specifications are used to define the data elements which are
EX to make up the extract file.  The extract file items and format will
EX correspond to the extract specification sequence and format.
EX
EX Enter the file/field name.  Press Enter at Type prompt to retrieve
EX the data dictionary definition for this field (or space out Type and
EX press Enter to retrieve).  You may now change these characteristics
EX to reform the data within the following limitations :  data type must
EX not change from numeric to non-numeric and vice versa.  The input
EX field will be reformatted using logical rules from its file format to
EX the format (type, length, decs, sign) defined here.  (logical rules
EX means A/N fields will have right end padded with spaces or truncated
EX - numeric fields will be left zero filled or truncated, decs will be
EX properly handled.  The item will then be stored as defined by the
EX data type and length IF there is no edit mask.  If there is a mask
EX then the reformatted field value is stored in edited form using the
EX edited length.  Keyed extract files are currently NOT supported.

LK *********************************************************************
LK     PCS Report Generator - Linking Specification Help
LK *********************************************************************
LK
LK Linking is the method used to convey to the program how to access
LK secondary files in a multifile report.  The data dictionary may
LK contain "paths" from one file to an other and, if so, the program
LK will attempt to build paths using the data dictionary definitions.
LK This is knows as automatic link resolution.  If the DD does not
LK contain paths or there are multiple possible paths, this screen will
LK appear.  (Linking is by far the most complex part of this system).
LK
LK Linking entails defining what value is used from the "main" file to
LK access a corresponding record on a secondary file.  The field on the
LK secondary file must be defined as a key field (the only way to get
LK a record).  An example is ORDER CUSTOMERNUMBER links to ORDER NUMBER
LK Here the data element on the Order file which contains the value of
LK the customer number is used to retrieve the Customer record by way
LK of the Customer key.
LK
LK To build a compound key, repeat the "to" key field listing the com-
LK ponent "from" fields.  All values must be data type X in this case.
LK It is recommended that in principle the keys be defined as X (they
LK may be redefined properly for use as a report print field).
