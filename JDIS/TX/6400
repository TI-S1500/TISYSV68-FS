      Dear Mr. Spear;

      On January 12, 1995 we sent in a proposal to St. Croix Co. Highway
      Department for 3 new JD 6400 tractors.  You stated in your letter
      of 6 October, 1994 that we needed more market share, so we bid three
      tractors at net, less 15%(JD discount); less 3%(volume); less 2%(3
      unit discount).  We added $1000 for each tractor to cover freight
      ($600) and set up($400).  We also put a bid in for the loader and cab.

      The following are quotes of the bids for the 6400 tractor:

      Meyer Implement, Inc.                  Polfus Implement

      $ 85,500 w/power quad                  $ 76,270.53 w/ syncro trans.
        13,950 cab                             15,281.76 cab
        13,485 loader                          10,652.76 loader
                                                4,421.70 power-quad trans.
      ________                               ___________
      $112,935.00                            $106,626.75

      The difference of $6309.00 (or $2,103.00 per tractor) seems like
      alot of money to take out of our pocket!

      We would ask that you check our proposal for accuracy.  If the
      government discounts and the discount for each dealer is correct,
      is John Deere suggesting that we will need to buy our market share?

      Hammond, WI is 3 miles from us while Polfus is 14 miles away.  How
      do you explain the trade area with New Richmond placing this low bid
      in our area?

      Enclosed are coies of the results and our prices.

      Sincerely,


      Stanley Meyer
