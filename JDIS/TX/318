Dear Mr. Spear,

On April 10, 1995 I stopped at Speer's True Value in River Falls and found they
had five new 318 Lawn and Garden Tractors in front of the store.  Serial numbers
are:   M00318X115407
       M00318X115385
       M00318X115650
       M00318X115353
       M00318X115055
In 1994, Polfus Implement had Lawn and Garden literature and John Deere paint
for sale in Speer's store.  John Deere parts can be ordered through Speer's with
Polfus delivering the parts to the store.

In your letter of 23 Nov. 1994 you clarified that Deere does not allow an
unauthorized party, in an anauthorized location to sell new John Deere products.
If this is not allowed, why are the lawn tractors still at Speer's?

As I indicated in my letter of October 20, 1994, Polfus Implement had lawn
mowers at Speer's in River Falls.  Our customers have been quoted prices of
other John Deere models of lawn tractors as well from Speer's.

If this continues, will we be allowed to follow their example by selling lawn
tractors for resale to businesses in other towns?

Sincerely,



Stanley Meyer, President
Meyer Implement, Inc.
