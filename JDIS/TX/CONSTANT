JAMES SPEAR;

ON SATURDAY, JUNE 17, 1995, DONNA CONSTANT WAS IN OUR SHOP AND SHOWED US A COPY
OF HER SALES RECEIPT FROM SPEERS TRUE VALUE IN RIVER FALLS, WISCONSIN FOR A
CARBURETOR (#AM116338) SHE HAD BOUGHT FROM THEM.  LIST PRICE IS $86.25.  SHE
PAID $106.00.  DONNA TOLD ME THEY ALSO STOCK BELTS, IDLERS AND OTHER MOWER
PARTS.	THIS ISN'T HELPING DEERE'S IMAGE, ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY ARE NOT AN
AUTHORIZED DEALER.

ON MAY 25, 1995 RICK TAYLOR TOLD ME THAT CHUCK POLFUS GAVE HIM HIS WORD THAT ALL
LITERATURE AND PARTS WOULD BE OUT OF TRUE VALUE.  COULD RICK PERSONALLY STOP AND
CHECK SPEER'S TRUE VALUE?

RICK WAS HERE JUNE 16TH.  IF WE SHOWED OUR FEELINGS AND ACTIONS TO OUR
CUSTOMERS LIKE RICK DID HERE, AND IF THEY WOULD FILL OUT A CUSTOMER SATISFACTION
SURVEY, HOW MANY CUSTOMERS WOULD RETURN IN THE FUTURE?	HAS RICK SEEN THE
PATHFINDER ON TREATING CUSTOMERS RIGHT?  REMEMBER, WE ARE YOUR CUSTOMERS.

WE HOPE THESE PROBLEMS CAN BE TAKEN CARE OF AND WILL BE WAITING FOR A REPLY.

SINCERELY,



STANLEY MEYER, PRESIDENT
MEYER IMPLEMENT, INC.
