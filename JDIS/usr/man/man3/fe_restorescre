FE_RESTORESCREEN(3T)                         FE_RESTORESCREEN(3T)

NAME
     FE_restorescreen - Restores field edit screen image

SYNOPSIS
     #include <vdtrdwrt.h>

     extern int errno;
     int status, fd ;
     status = FE_restorescreen(fd);

DESCRIPTION
     The FE_restorescreen function causes field edit to restore
     the saved screen image to the terminal.  The function writes
     an erase screen command to the terminal and then writes the
     screen image data with cursor and display attribute
     information.  The fd parameter is the TI System V file
     descriptor being used in the current field edit session.
     The status and errno parameters return error information.

     The FE_restorescreen, in conjunction with FE_savescreen(3T),
     is intended for use with help screens and similar functions.
     The FE_savescreen function causes field edit to save the
     current screen image and not process field edit read or
     write calls through the screen image until an
     FE_restorescreen function is processed.  An application can
     issue an FE_savescreen call, write any number of screens,
     and issue any number of read requests.  When the terminal
     operator indicates that he or she wishes to return to the
     previous screen, the application calls FE_restorescreen,
     which causes the saved screen image to be restored to the
     terminal.

     You can save only one image per terminal at any one time.
     If you need to save multiple screen images, use
     FE_exportscreen(3T).

RETURN VALUES
     The function can return the following values in status:

      0 - No errors.
     -1 - Error. The errno variable contains one of the following
     error codes:
          EFE_BADFD - An invalid file descriptor was used; that
          is, a file descriptor different from the file
          descriptor used in the FE_open call.
          EFE_NOIMAGE - Field edit is not keeping a screen image
          for this terminal (variable SCRNIMAGE not set) or the
          screen image has not been saved by a preceding
          FE_savescreen call.
          See the /usr/include/sys/errno.h file for other system
          error codes.
