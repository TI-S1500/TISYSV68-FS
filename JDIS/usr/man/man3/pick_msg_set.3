PICK_MSG_SET(3T)				 PICK_MSG_SET(3T)

NAME
     pick_msg_set - Selects the directory where printm(3T) looks
     for message texts

SYNOPSIS
     pick_msg_set(min, max, dir)

     long min, max;
     char *dir;

DESCRIPTION
   Function
     The pick_msg_set routine selects the directory that contains
     the message text files for messages with tag number in the
     range min to max.

   Parameters
     dir  The name of the directory that contains the two
	  subdirectories, ptext and stext.  The ptext
	  subdirectory contains the problem description text. The
	  stext subdirectory contains the solution description
	  text.

	  The pick_msg_set routine appends the /ptext/USA and the
	  /stext/USA components to the specified directory passed
	  by the user program.	The file name USA specifies
	  English text.

     min max
	  The printm routine accesses the file indicated by the
	  pick_msg_set call if the message text tag number is
	  between the numbers min and max, inclusive.

EXAMPLE
     Assume that the following statement is executed before a
     call to printm:

	  pick_msg_set( 7000, 8000, "/usr/customer/msg" )

     The printm routine retrieves the message texts from the file
     /usr/customer/msg/ptext/USA and /usr/customer/msg/stext/USA
     if the message tag number is between 7,000 and 8,000.

     If the message tag number is 1,000,000 or greater, printm
     accesses /ti/ptext/USA and /ti/stext/USA.
