FE_SAVESCREEN(3T)                               FE_SAVESCREEN(3T)

NAME
     FE_savescreen - Saves field edit screen image

SYNOPSIS
     #include <vdtrdwrt.h>

     extern int errno;
     int status, fd;
     status = FE_savescreen(fd);

DESCRIPTION
     The FE_savescreen function causes field edit to save the
     screen image.  Subsequent read and write requests are not
     processed through field edit until an FE_restorescreen(3T)
     call is issued.  If the no_raw_writes optimization is on,
     the terminal is restored to cooked mode (the opost flag is
     set) in order to properly process UNIX-mode write
     requests.   The fd parameter is the TI System V file
     descriptor used in the current field edit session.  The
     status and errno parameters return error information.

     Use the FE_savescreen function in conjunction with
     FE_restorescreen(3T) to implement help screens and similar
     tasks.  An application can call FE_savescreen, issue any
     number of read or write requests using the desired terminal
     access method, and then issue the FE_restorescreen call.
     The terminal screen is restored to the same state it was in
     prior to the FE_savescreen call.

     Only one screen image per terminal can be saved at any one
     time.  If one FE_savescreen call has been issued for a
     terminal and an FE_restorescreen call has not been issued,
     subsequent FE_savescreen calls have no effect and return no
     error.  If multiple screen images must be saved (for nested
     help screens, for example), you must use
     FE_exportscreen(3T).

RETURN VALUES
     The function can return the following values in status:

      0 - No errors.
     -1 - Error.  The errno variable contains one of the
     following error codes:
          EFE_BADFD - An invalid file descriptor was used; that
          is, a file descriptor different from the file
          descriptor used in the FE_open call.
          EFE_NOIMAGE - Field edit is not keeping a screen image
          for this terminal.
          See the /usr/include/sys/errno.h file for other system
          error codes.
