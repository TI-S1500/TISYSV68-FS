FE_IMPORTSCREEN(3T)                           FE_IMPORTSCREEN(3T)

NAME
     FE_importscreen - Imports field edit screen image

SYNOPSIS
     #include <vdtrdwrt.h>

     extern int errno;
     int status, fd, length;
     struct FE_screen *screen;
     status = FE_importscreen(fd, screen, length);

DESCRIPTION
     The FE_importscreen function causes field edit to make the
     screen image data structure, pointed to by the parameter
     screen, into the current screen image.  This screen image
     will be current both on the terminal screen and in field
     edit memory.

     The fd parameter is the TI System V file descriptor used
     during the current field edit session.  The screen parameter
     is a pointer to a screen image data structure, as described
     in vdtrdwrt.h(4).  The length parameter specifies the length
     of that data structure.  You can calculate the length as
     follows:
          length = ((sizeof(struct attributes) +
          1)*maxrow*maxcol)+ sizeof(struct FE_screen);

     where maxrow and maxcol are the maximum row and column
     positions for that terminal type.  These positions are
     usually 24 and 80, respectively.

     If the length parameter is correct and field edit is
     currently keeping a screen image, the following events
     occur:

     + The data pointed to by screen is copied into the field
       edit screen image data structure.

     + An erase-screen command is written to the terminal.

     + The screen is redrawn from the new image.

RETURN VALUES
     status = 0 - No errors
     status = -1 - Error. The errno variable contains one of the
     following error codes:
          EFE_BADFD - Invalid file descriptor (one different from
          the file descriptor used in the FE_open call).
          EFE_BADLEN - Length parameter was not correct.
          EFE_NOIMAGE - No screen image is currently being kept
          for this terminal.
