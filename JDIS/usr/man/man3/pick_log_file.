PICK_LOG_FILE(3T)                               PICK_LOG_FILE(3T)

NAME
     pick_log_file - Selects an alternate file to contain
     messages logged by the printm(3T) function

SYNOPSIS
     pick_log_file( filename )

     char *filename;

DESCRIPTION
   Function
     The pick_log_file routine appends error messages logged by
     the printm routine to filename rather than to the standard
     system error log file, /etc/SYS.ERR.LOG.

   Parameters
     filename
            The name of the file that receives messages logged
            after the pick_log_file routine is called.  Messages
            logged prior to the routine call are logged to the
            standard system error log file.

            To log messages to the standard system error log file
            after calling the pick_log_file routine, use the
            following statement:

            pick_log_file( (char*)NULL )

EXAMPLE
     The following statement, executed before a call to printm,
     appends to /usr/customer/log any messages that are logged:

          pick_log_file( "/usr/customer/log" )

SEE ALSO
     printm(3T).
