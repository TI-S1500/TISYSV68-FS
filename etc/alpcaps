#SPECIAL FILE: /etc/alpcaps                                                    
#                                                                               
#       The file /etc/alpcaps is used to specify parameters that will be used   
#to initialize the attached line printer driver.  These parameters define the   
#following items:                                                               
#
#       1) Terminal type as defined in /etc/termcaps.                      
#
#       2) Printer Begin Bracket.(bb) This is the character sequence that
#          needs to be sent to the terminal so that subsequent data is directed 
#          to the attached printer device.                                     
#                                                                               
#       3) Printer End Bracket.(eb)  The character sequence that terminates the 
#          data stream that is directed to the attached printer.                
#                                                                               
#       4) Pacing response.(pr)  The character sequence that is sent by the     
#          terminal to acknowledge the previous printer directed data           
#          stream.  The receipt of this string indicates that the terminal      
#          is ready to receive more printer data.  Some terminals do not        
#          support this feature, if not, the appropriate entry is a Null        
#          string (i.e \0).  For Terminals that do not support a pacing         
#          response, the Block Transmit Rate is used to pace the printer data.  
#                                                                               
#       5) Block size.(sz)  This specifies the size of the printer data block to
#          be sent to the attached printer as a contigious stream.  Some        
#          terminals have a defined limit while others do not (they use         
#          XON,XOFF to pace the data).  A reasonable number is 80 to 128.       
#                                                                               
#       6) Block Transmit Rate.(rt)  This specifies how often a printer data   
#          block should be sent to the terminal. This has units in 
#          milliseconds. Actual resolution is +- 250 milliseconds. This
#          may change to 100 milliseconds in the future. The
#          block size and transmit rate parameters allows for customization of  
#          how much of the terminals bandwidth can be allocated to the attached 
#          printer.   By proper selection of these parameters, both printer     
#          and terminal data can flow without noticable delays of either.       
#          If the terminal supports a Pacing Response, this number is not used. 
#
