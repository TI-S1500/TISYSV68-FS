# /dev/alpxx bb=___ eb=___ pr=___ sz=___ rt=___
#                                                                               
#       The file /etc/alpdefs is used to specify parameters that will be used   
#to initialize the vdt attached line printer driver. The Device Adminstrator
#will provide entries in this file for the terminals defined in the file
#/etc/alpcaps. These are a best guess estimate of how the vdt attached 
#printing should be done. 
#       To add a new terminal type edit the file /etc/alpcaps.
#To change the parameters associated with a particular vdt attached printer 
#edit this file.
#       The parameters define the following items:
#                                                                               
#       1) Printer Pathname. (/dev/alpxx assigned by devadm(1T)) The pathname
#          of the attached printer device.     
#                                                                               
#       2) Printer Begin Bracket. (bb)  This is the character sequence that
#          needs to be sent to the terminal so that subsequent data is directed
#          to the attached printer device.                                   
#                                                                               
#       3) Printer End Bracket. (eb) The character sequence that terminates the 
#          data stream that is directed to the attached printer.                
#                                                                               
#       4) Pacing response. (pr) The character sequence that is sent by the     
#          terminal to acknowledge the previous printer directed data           
#          stream.  The receipt of this string indicates that the terminal      
#          is ready to receive more printer data.  Some terminals do not        
#          support this feature, if not, the appropriate entry is a Null        
#          string (i.e \0).  For Terminals that do not support a pacing         
#          response, the Block Transmit Rate is used to pace the printer data.  
#                                                                               
#       5) Block size. (sz) This specifies the size of the printer data block  
#          to be sent to the attached printer as a contigious stream.  Some     
#          terminals have a defined limit while others do not (they use         
#          XON,XOFF to pace the data).  A reasonable number is 80 to 128.       
#                                                                               
#       6) Block Transmit Rate. (rt) This specifies how often a printer data   
#          block should be sent to the terminal. This has units in milliseconds.
#          The actual resolution is in units of 250 milliseconds. This may
#          be changed to 100 milliseconds at some point in  the future. 
#          The block size and transmit rate parameters allows for customization
#          of how much of the terminals bandwidth can be allocated to the vdt 
#          atached printer. By proper selection of these parameters, both 
#          printer and terminal data can flow without noticable delays of 
#          either. If the terminal supports a Pacing Response, this number 
#          is not used. 
#                                                                               
#                                                                               
#       The following are some examples of /etc/alpdefs file entries.
#An escape character can be specified using the \E macro (or using the
#standard octal representation \033). '\' are represented by a '\\' sequence. 
#The # character before the VDT-attached printer pathname implies that the
#entire line be treated as a comment.

#       Attached printer paramters                                              
#
#    for 931 using positive acknowledgement                                   
#
#
#     for vt220 with no pacing response and 7 bit controls
#
#    for other examples see the file /etc/alpcaps.
#
#        The alpdefs file is read by the initterm process, which initializes
# the terminal driver with the VDT-attached printer parameters. If you change
# a parameter in this file you must execute the following:
#                                                                              
#              /etc/initterm p                                                 
#                                                                               
#        This program will be executed as part of the init process.
